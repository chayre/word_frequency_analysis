WATSON, M.D.,\r\n_Late of the Army Medical Department._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nMR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\r\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\r\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\r\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\r\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I\r\ncould join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\r\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\r\nwas already deep in the enemy\u2019s country. I followed, however, with many\r\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\r\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\r\nentered upon my new duties.\r\n\r\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\r\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\r\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\r\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\r\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\r\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\r\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\r\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\r\n\r\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\r\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\r\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\r\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\r\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\r\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\r\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak\r\nand emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be\r\nlost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in\r\nthe troopship \u201cOrontes,\u201d and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty,\r\nwith my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a\r\npaternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to\r\nimprove it.\r\n\r\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\r\nair\u2014or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\r\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\r\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\r\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a\r\nprivate hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\r\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\r\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I\r\nsoon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\r\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\r\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\r\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\r\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\r\n\r\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\r\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\r\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\r\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London\r\nis a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had\r\nnever been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with\r\nenthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In\r\nthe exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn,\r\nand we started off together in a hansom.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?\u201d he asked in\r\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\r\n\u201cYou are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.\u201d\r\n\r\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\r\nby the time that we reached our destination.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor devil!\u201d he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\r\nmisfortunes. \u201cWhat are you up to now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLooking for lodgings,\u201d I answered. \u201cTrying to solve the problem as to\r\nwhether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a strange thing,\u201d remarked my companion; \u201cyou are the second\r\nman to-day that has used that expression to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who was the first?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cA fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\r\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\r\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\r\nwere too much for his purse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy Jove!\u201d I cried, \u201cif he really wants someone to share the rooms and\r\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a\r\npartner to being alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. \u201cYou\r\ndon\u2019t know Sherlock Holmes yet,\u201d he said; \u201cperhaps you would not care\r\nfor him as a constant companion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what is there against him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\r\nin his ideas\u2014an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\r\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA medical student, I suppose?\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\r\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\r\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\r\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the\r\nway knowledge which would astonish his professors.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you never ask him what he was going in for?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\r\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to meet him,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I am to lodge with anyone, I\r\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\r\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\r\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\r\ncould I meet this friend of yours?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is sure to be at the laboratory,\u201d returned my companion. \u201cHe either\r\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\r\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\r\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\r\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t blame me if you don\u2019t get on with him,\u201d he said; \u201cI know\r\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally\r\nin the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold\r\nme responsible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get on it will be easy to part company,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt\r\nseems to me, Stamford,\u201d I added, looking hard at my companion, \u201cthat\r\nyou have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this\r\nfellow\u2019s temper so formidable, or what is it? Don\u2019t be mealy-mouthed\r\nabout it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not easy to express the inexpressible,\u201d he answered with a\r\nlaugh. \u201cHolmes is a little too scientific for my tastes\u2014it approaches\r\nto cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch\r\nof the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you\r\nunderstand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an\r\naccurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would\r\ntake it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion\r\nfor definite and exact knowledge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery right too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the\r\nsubjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking\r\nrather a bizarre shape.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBeating the subjects!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him\r\nat it with my own eyes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet you say he is not a medical student?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are,\r\nand you must form your own impressions about him.\u201d As he spoke, we\r\nturned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which\r\nopened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me,\r\nand I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and\r\nmade our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall\r\nand dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage\r\nbranched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.\r\n\r\nThis was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\r\nBroad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,\r\ntest-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.\r\nThere was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant\r\ntable absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round\r\nand sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \u201cI\u2019ve found it! I\u2019ve\r\nfound it,\u201d he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a\r\ntest-tube in his hand. \u201cI have found a re-agent which is precipitated\r\nby h\u00e6moglobin, and by nothing else.\u201d Had he discovered a gold mine,\r\ngreater delight could not have shone upon his features.\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d said Stamford, introducing us.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for\r\nwhich I should hardly have given him credit. \u201cYou have been in\r\nAfghanistan, I perceive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow on earth did you know that?\u201d I asked in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said he, chuckling to himself. \u201cThe question now is about\r\nh\u00e6moglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of\r\nmine?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is interesting, chemically, no doubt,\u201d I answered, \u201cbut\r\npractically\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\r\nDon\u2019t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains.\r\nCome over here now!\u201d He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness,\r\nand drew me over to the table at which he had been working. \u201cLet us\r\nhave some fresh blood,\u201d he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger,\r\nand drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette.\r\n\u201cNow, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You\r\nperceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water.\r\nThe proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no\r\ndoubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic\r\nreaction.\u201d As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals,\r\nand then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the\r\ncontents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was\r\nprecipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\r\nchild with a new toy. \u201cWhat do you think of that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to be a very delicate test,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\r\nuncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The\r\nlatter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this\r\nappears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test\r\nbeen invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who\r\nwould long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed!\u201d I murmured.\r\n\r\n\u201cCriminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\r\nsuspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His\r\nlinen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon\r\nthem. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit\r\nstains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an\r\nexpert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the\r\nSherlock Holmes\u2019 test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\r\nheart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are to be congratulated,\u201d I remarked, considerably surprised at\r\nhis enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would\r\ncertainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there\r\nwas Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of\r\nMontpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases\r\nin which it would have been decisive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to be a walking calendar of crime,\u201d said Stamford with a\r\nlaugh. \u201cYou might start a paper on those lines. Call it the \u2018Police\r\nNews of the Past.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery interesting reading it might be made, too,\u201d remarked Sherlock\r\nHolmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.\r\n\u201cI have to be careful,\u201d he continued, turning to me with a smile, \u201cfor\r\nI dabble with poisons a good deal.\u201d He held out his hand as he spoke,\r\nand I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of\r\nplaster, and discoloured with strong acids.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe came here on business,\u201d said Stamford, sitting down on a high\r\nthree-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his\r\nfoot. \u201cMy friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were\r\ncomplaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought\r\nthat I had better bring you together.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with\r\nme. \u201cI have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich would\r\nsuit us down to the ground. You don\u2019t mind the smell of strong tobacco,\r\nI hope?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI always smoke \u2018ship\u2019s\u2019 myself,\u201d I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally\r\ndo experiments. Would that annoy you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see\u2014what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at\r\ntimes, and don\u2019t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am\r\nsulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I\u2019ll soon be right. What\r\nhave you to confess now? It\u2019s just as well for two fellows to know the\r\nworst of one another before they begin to live together.\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed at this cross-examination. \u201cI keep a bull pup,\u201d I said, \u201cand\r\nI object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all\r\nsorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of\r\nvices when I\u2019m well, but those are the principal ones at present.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you include violin-playing in your category of rows?\u201d he asked,\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt depends on the player,\u201d I answered. \u201cA well-played violin is a\r\ntreat for the gods\u2014a badly-played one\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s all right,\u201d he cried, with a merry laugh. \u201cI think we may\r\nconsider the thing as settled\u2014that is, if the rooms are agreeable to\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen shall we see them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCall for me here at noon to-morrow, and we\u2019ll go together and settle\r\neverything,\u201d he answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right\u2014noon exactly,\u201d said I, shaking his hand.\r\n\r\nWe left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards\r\nmy hotel.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford,\r\n\u201chow the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?\u201d\r\n\r\nMy companion smiled an enigmatical smile. \u201cThat\u2019s just his little\r\npeculiarity,\u201d he said. \u201cA good many people have wanted to know how he\r\nfinds things out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! a mystery is it?\u201d I cried, rubbing my hands. \u201cThis is very\r\npiquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. \u2018The proper\r\nstudy of mankind is man,\u2019 you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must study him, then,\u201d Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find him a knotty problem, though. I\u2019ll wager he learns more\r\nabout you than you about him. Good-bye.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye,\u201d I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably\r\ninterested in my new acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nTHE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No.\r\n221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\r\nconsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy\r\nsitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\r\nwindows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate\r\ndid the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was\r\nconcluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That\r\nvery evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\r\nfollowing morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and\r\nportmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and\r\nlaying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually\r\nbegan to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nHolmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in\r\nhis ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up\r\nafter ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\r\nbefore I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the\r\nchemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and\r\noccasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest\r\nportions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working\r\nfit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for\r\ndays on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly\r\nuttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these\r\noccasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes,\r\nthat I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some\r\nnarcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life\r\nforbidden such a notion.\r\n\r\nAs the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\r\naims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and\r\nappearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\r\nobserver. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\r\nlean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and\r\npiercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have\r\nalluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air\r\nof alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and\r\nsquareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were\r\ninvariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was\r\npossessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had\r\noccasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile\r\nphilosophical instruments.\r\n\r\nThe reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how\r\nmuch this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to\r\nbreak through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned\r\nhimself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\r\nobjectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my\r\nattention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather\r\nwas exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me\r\nand break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these\r\ncircumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my\r\ncompanion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.\r\n\r\nHe was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\r\nconfirmed Stamford\u2019s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to\r\nhave pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in\r\nscience or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance\r\ninto the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was\r\nremarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so\r\nextraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly\r\nastounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise\r\ninformation unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers\r\nare seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man\r\nburdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason\r\nfor doing so.\r\n\r\nHis ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary\r\nliterature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to\r\nnothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way\r\nwho he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax,\r\nhowever, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the\r\nCopernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any\r\ncivilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware\r\nthat the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an\r\nextraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou appear to be astonished,\u201d he said, smiling at my expression of\r\nsurprise. \u201cNow that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo forget it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d he explained, \u201cI consider that a man\u2019s brain originally is\r\nlike a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture\r\nas you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he\r\ncomes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets\r\ncrowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so\r\nthat he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful\r\nworkman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his\r\nbrain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in\r\ndoing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the\r\nmost perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has\r\nelastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes\r\na time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that\r\nyou knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to\r\nhave useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the Solar System!\u201d I protested.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the deuce is it to me?\u201d he interrupted impatiently; \u201cyou say that\r\nwe go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a\r\npennyworth of difference to me or to my work.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something\r\nin his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I\r\npondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw\r\nmy deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which\r\ndid not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he\r\npossessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own\r\nmind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was\r\nexceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down.\r\nI could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It\r\nran in this way\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nSHERLOCK HOLMES\u2014his limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Knowledge of Literature.\u2014Nil.\r\n2. Philosophy.\u2014Nil.\r\n3. Astronomy.\u2014Nil.\r\n4. Politics.\u2014Feeble.\r\n5. Botany.\u2014Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons\r\ngenerally. Knows nothing of practical gardening.\r\n6. Geology.\u2014Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils\r\nfrom each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers,\r\nand told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he\r\nhad received them.\r\n7. Chemistry.\u2014Profound.\r\n8. Anatomy.\u2014Accurate, but unsystematic.\r\n9. Sensational Literature.\u2014Immense. He appears to know every detail of\r\nevery horror perpetrated in the century.\r\n10. Plays the violin well.\r\n11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.\r\n12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.\r\n\u201cIf I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all\r\nthese accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,\u201d\r\nI said to myself, \u201cI may as well give up the attempt at once.\u201d\r\n\r\nI see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These\r\nwere very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other\r\naccomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I\r\nknew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn\u2019s\r\nLieder, and other favourites. When left to himself, however, he would\r\nseldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in\r\nhis arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape\r\ncarelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes\r\nthe chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were\r\nfantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which\r\npossessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether\r\nthe playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I\r\ncould determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos\r\nhad it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick\r\nsuccession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation\r\nfor the trial upon my patience.\r\n\r\nDuring the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think\r\nthat my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,\r\nhowever, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most\r\ndifferent classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,\r\ndark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came\r\nthree or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,\r\nfashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same\r\nafternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew\r\npedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely\r\nfollowed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old\r\nwhite-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on\r\nanother a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these\r\nnondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to\r\nbeg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.\r\nHe always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. \u201cI\r\nhave to use this room as a place of business,\u201d he said, \u201cand these\r\npeople are my clients.\u201d Again I had an opportunity of asking him a\r\npoint blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing\r\nanother man to confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some\r\nstrong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by\r\ncoming round to the subject of his own accord.\r\n\r\nIt was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I\r\nrose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had\r\nnot yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed\r\nto my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee\r\nprepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell\r\nand gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a\r\nmagazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it,\r\nwhile my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles\r\nhad a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\nIts somewhat ambitious title was \u201cThe Book of Life,\u201d and it attempted\r\nto show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and\r\nsystematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as\r\nbeing a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The\r\nreasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to\r\nbe far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary\r\nexpression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a\r\nman\u2019s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility\r\nin the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions\r\nwere as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling\r\nwould his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the\r\nprocesses by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him\r\nas a necromancer.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom a drop of water,\u201d said the writer, \u201ca logician could infer the\r\npossibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of\r\none or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is\r\nknown whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,\r\nthe Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired\r\nby long and patient study nor, is life long enough to allow any mortal\r\nto attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to\r\nthose moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest\r\ndifficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary\r\nproblems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to\r\ndistinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to\r\nwhich he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the\r\nfaculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to\r\nlook for. By a man\u2019s finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by\r\nhis trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by\r\nhis expression, by his shirt cuffs\u2014by each of these things a man\u2019s\r\ncalling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten\r\nthe competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat ineffable twaddle!\u201d I cried, slapping the magazine down on the\r\ntable, \u201cI never read such rubbish in my life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, this article,\u201d I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat\r\ndown to my breakfast. \u201cI see that you have read it since you have\r\nmarked it. I don\u2019t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me\r\nthough. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who\r\nevolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own\r\nstudy. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a\r\nthird class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades\r\nof all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against\r\nhim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou would lose your money,\u201d Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. \u201cAs for\r\nthe article I wrote it myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The\r\ntheories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so\r\nchimerical are really extremely practical\u2014so practical that I depend\r\nupon them for my bread and cheese.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how?\u201d I asked involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the\r\nworld. I\u2019m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.\r\nHere in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of\r\nprivate ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I\r\nmanage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before\r\nme, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history\r\nof crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance\r\nabout misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your\r\nfinger ends, it is odd if you can\u2019t unravel the thousand and first.\r\nLestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently\r\nover a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd these other people?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all\r\npeople who are in trouble about something, and want a little\r\nenlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and\r\nthen I pocket my fee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut do you mean to say,\u201d I said, \u201cthat without leaving your room you\r\ncan unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although\r\nthey have seen every detail for themselves?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case\r\nturns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about\r\nand see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special\r\nknowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters\r\nwonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which\r\naroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation\r\nwith me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you,\r\non our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were told, no doubt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long\r\nhabit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I\r\narrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate\r\nsteps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran,\r\n\u2018Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military\r\nman. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics,\r\nfor his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for\r\nhis wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his\r\nhaggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it\r\nin a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English\r\narmy doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in\r\nAfghanistan.\u2019 The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I\r\nthen remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is simple enough as you explain it,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cYou remind\r\nme of Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did\r\nexist outside of stories.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. \u201cNo doubt you think that you are\r\ncomplimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,\u201d he observed. \u201cNow, in my\r\nopinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of\r\nbreaking in on his friends\u2019 thoughts with an apropos remark after a\r\nquarter of an hour\u2019s silence is really very showy and superficial. He\r\nhad some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a\r\nphenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you read Gaboriau\u2019s works?\u201d I asked. \u201cDoes Lecoq come up to your\r\nidea of a detective?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. \u201cLecoq was a miserable bungler,\u201d\r\nhe said, in an angry voice; \u201che had only one thing to recommend him,\r\nand that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question\r\nwas how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in\r\ntwenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a\r\ntext-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid.\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired\r\ntreated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood\r\nlooking out into the busy street. \u201cThis fellow may be very clever,\u201d I\r\nsaid to myself, \u201cbut he is certainly very conceited.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are no crimes and no criminals in these days,\u201d he said,\r\nquerulously. \u201cWhat is the use of having brains in our profession. I\r\nknow well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or\r\nhas ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural\r\ntalent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the\r\nresult? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling\r\nvillainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard\r\nofficial can see through it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought\r\nit best to change the topic.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder what that fellow is looking for?\u201d I asked, pointing to a\r\nstalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the\r\nother side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a\r\nlarge blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean the retired sergeant of Marines,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrag and bounce!\u201d thought I to myself. \u201cHe knows that I cannot verify\r\nhis guess.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were\r\nwatching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across\r\nthe roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps\r\nascending the stair.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d he said, stepping into the room and handing\r\nmy friend the letter.\r\n\r\nHere was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little\r\nthought of this when he made that random shot. \u201cMay I ask, my lad,\u201d I\r\nsaid, in the blandest voice, \u201cwhat your trade may be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCommissionaire, sir,\u201d he said, gruffly. \u201cUniform away for repairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you were?\u201d I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\u201cA sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right,\r\nsir.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTHE LAURISTON GARDENS MYSTERY\r\n\r\n\r\nI confess that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the\r\npractical nature of my companion\u2019s theories. My respect for his powers\r\nof analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking\r\nsuspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged\r\nepisode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could\r\nhave in taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he\r\nhad finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant,\r\nlack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow in the world did you deduce that?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cDeduce what?\u201d said he, petulantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no time for trifles,\u201d he answered, brusquely; then with a\r\nsmile, \u201cExcuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but\r\nperhaps it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that\r\nman was a sergeant of Marines?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you were\r\nasked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some\r\ndifficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the\r\nstreet I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the\r\nfellow\u2019s hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage,\r\nhowever, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was\r\na man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command.\r\nYou must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his\r\ncane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of\r\nhim\u2014all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cCommonplace,\u201d said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that\r\nhe was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. \u201cI said just now\r\nthat there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong\u2014look at this!\u201d\r\nHe threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d I cried, as I cast my eye over it, \u201cthis is terrible!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt does seem to be a little out of the common,\u201d he remarked, calmly.\r\n\u201cWould you mind reading it to me aloud?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is the letter which I read to him\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThere has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston\r\nGardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there\r\nabout two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected\r\nthat something was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front\r\nroom, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman,\r\nwell dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of \u2018Enoch\r\nJ. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.\u2019 There had been no robbery, nor is\r\nthere any evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of\r\nblood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a\r\nloss as to how he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair\r\nis a puzzler. If you can come round to the house any time before\r\ntwelve, you will find me there. I have left everything _in statu quo_\r\nuntil I hear from you. If you are unable to come I shall give you\r\nfuller details, and would esteem it a great kindness if you would\r\nfavour me with your opinion.\r\n\r\n              Yours faithfully,\r\n                  \u201cTOBIAS GREGSON.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,\u201d my friend remarked;\r\n\u201che and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and\r\nenergetic, but conventional\u2014shockingly so. They have their knives into\r\none another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional\r\nbeauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put\r\nupon the scent.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. \u201cSurely there is\r\nnot a moment to be lost,\u201d I cried, \u201cshall I go and order you a cab?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy\r\ndevil that ever stood in shoe leather\u2014that is, when the fit is on me,\r\nfor I can be spry enough at times.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the\r\nwhole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will\r\npocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he begs you to help him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but\r\nhe would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person.\r\nHowever, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my\r\nown hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that\r\nan energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet your hat,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wish me to come?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, if you have nothing better to do.\u201d A minute later we were both in\r\na hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.\r\n\r\nIt was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the\r\nhouse-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets\r\nbeneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away\r\nabout Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an\r\nAmati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the\r\nmelancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,\u201d I said at\r\nlast, interrupting Holmes\u2019 musical disquisition.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo data yet,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt is a capital mistake to theorize before\r\nyou have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will have your data soon,\u201d I remarked, pointing with my finger;\r\n\u201cthis is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much\r\nmistaken.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it is. Stop, driver, stop!\u201d We were still a hundred yards or so\r\nfrom it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our\r\njourney upon foot.\r\n\r\nNumber 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It\r\nwas one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two\r\nbeing occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of\r\nvacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here\r\nand there a \u201cTo Let\u201d card had developed like a cataract upon the\r\nbleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption\r\nof sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and\r\nwas traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting\r\napparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very\r\nsloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was\r\nbounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the\r\ntop, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable,\r\nsurrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and\r\nstrained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the\r\nproceedings within.\r\n\r\nI had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the\r\nhouse and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be\r\nfurther from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the\r\ncircumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up\r\nand down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the\r\nopposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny,\r\nhe proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass\r\nwhich flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice\r\nhe stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an\r\nexclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon\r\nthe wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going\r\nover it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn\r\nanything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the\r\nquickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he\r\ncould see a great deal which was hidden from me.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,\r\nflaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and\r\nwrung my companion\u2019s hand with effusion. \u201cIt is indeed kind of you to\r\ncome,\u201d he said, \u201cI have had everything left untouched.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcept that!\u201d my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. \u201cIf a herd\r\nof buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No\r\ndoubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you\r\npermitted this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have had so much to do inside the house,\u201d the detective said\r\nevasively. \u201cMy colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him\r\nto look after this.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. \u201cWith two\r\nsuch men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be\r\nmuch for a third party to find out,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nGregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. \u201cI think we have done\r\nall that can be done,\u201d he answered; \u201cit\u2019s a queer case though, and I\r\nknew your taste for such things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did not come here in a cab?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor Lestrade?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen let us go and look at the room.\u201d With which inconsequent remark\r\nhe strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features\r\nexpressed his astonishment.\r\n\r\nA short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and\r\noffices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One\r\nof these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged\r\nto the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious\r\naffair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that\r\nsubdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires.\r\n\r\nIt was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of\r\nall furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was\r\nblotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had\r\nbecome detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.\r\nOpposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of\r\nimitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a\r\nred wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was\r\nhazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was\r\nintensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nAll these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was\r\ncentred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon\r\nthe boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured\r\nceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of\r\nage, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and\r\na short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat\r\nand waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and\r\ncuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor\r\nbeside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while\r\nhis lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been\r\na grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,\r\nand as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human\r\nfeatures. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low\r\nforehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a\r\nsingularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his\r\nwrithing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never\r\nhas it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy\r\napartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nLestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway,\r\nand greeted my companion and myself.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis case will make a stir, sir,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIt beats anything I\r\nhave seen, and I am no chicken.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no clue?\u201d said Gregson.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone at all,\u201d chimed in Lestrade.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it\r\nintently. \u201cYou are sure that there is no wound?\u201d he asked, pointing to\r\nnumerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.\r\n\r\n\u201cPositive!\u201d cried both detectives.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual\u2014presumably\r\nthe murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the\r\ncircumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the\r\nyear \u201834. Do you remember the case, Gregson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRead it up\u2014you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It\r\nhas all been done before.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and\r\neverywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes\r\nwore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon.\r\nSo swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed\r\nthe minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the\r\ndead man\u2019s lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather\r\nboots.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has not been moved at all?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can take him to the mortuary now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing more\r\nto be learned.\u201d\r\n\r\nGregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered\r\nthe room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised\r\nhim, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed\r\nit up and stared at it with mystified eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a woman here,\u201d he cried. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s wedding-ring.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered\r\nround him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of\r\nplain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis complicates matters,\u201d said Gregson. \u201cHeaven knows, they were\r\ncomplicated enough before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure it doesn\u2019t simplify them?\u201d observed Holmes. \u201cThere\u2019s\r\nnothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his\r\npockets?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have it all here,\u201d said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects\r\nupon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. \u201cA gold watch, No. 97163,\r\nby Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold\r\nring, with masonic device. Gold pin\u2014bull-dog\u2019s head, with rubies as\r\neyes. Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of\r\nCleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse,\r\nbut loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition\r\nof Boccaccio\u2019s _Decameron_, with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the\r\nfly-leaf. Two letters\u2014one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph\r\nStangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt what address?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAmerican Exchange, Strand\u2014to be left till called for. They are both\r\nfrom the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their\r\nboats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about\r\nto return to New York.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did it at once, sir,\u201d said Gregson. \u201cI have had advertisements sent\r\nto all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American\r\nExchange, but he has not returned yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you sent to Cleveland?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe telegraphed this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you word your inquiries?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad\r\nof any information which could help us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to\r\nbe crucial?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI asked about Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case\r\nappears to hinge? Will you not telegraph again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have said all I have to say,\u201d said Gregson, in an offended voice.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make\r\nsome remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we\r\nwere holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,\r\nrubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Gregson,\u201d he said, \u201cI have just made a discovery of the highest\r\nimportance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a\r\ncareful examination of the walls.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe little man\u2019s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a\r\nstate of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his\r\ncolleague.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of\r\nwhich felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. \u201cNow, stand\r\nthere!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at that!\u201d he said, triumphantly.\r\n\r\nI have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this\r\nparticular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a\r\nyellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was\r\nscrawled in blood-red letters a single word\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nRACHE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think of that?\u201d cried the detective, with the air of a\r\nshowman exhibiting his show. \u201cThis was overlooked because it was in the\r\ndarkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The\r\nmurderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where\r\nit has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide\r\nanyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See\r\nthat candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was\r\nlit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion\r\nof the wall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?\u201d asked Gregson in\r\na depreciatory voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cMean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name\r\nRachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark\r\nmy words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a\r\nwoman named Rachel has something to do with it. It\u2019s all very well for\r\nyou to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever,\r\nbut the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI really beg your pardon!\u201d said my companion, who had ruffled the\r\nlittle man\u2019s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. \u201cYou\r\ncertainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,\r\nand, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the\r\nother participant in last night\u2019s mystery. I have not had time to\r\nexamine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying\r\nglass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly\r\nabout the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once\r\nlying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that\r\nhe appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to\r\nhimself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of\r\nexclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of\r\nencouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded\r\nof a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and\r\nforwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes\r\nacross the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his\r\nresearches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between\r\nmarks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying\r\nhis tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one\r\nplace he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the\r\nfloor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his\r\nglass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the\r\nmost minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he\r\nreplaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,\u201d he\r\nremarked with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad definition, but it does apply\r\nto detective work.\u201d\r\n\r\nGregson and Lestrade had watched the man\u0153uvres of their amateur\r\ncompanion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently\r\nfailed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that\r\nSherlock Holmes\u2019 smallest actions were all directed towards some\r\ndefinite and practical end.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think of it, sir?\u201d they both asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume\r\nto help you,\u201d remarked my friend. \u201cYou are doing so well now that it\r\nwould be a pity for anyone to interfere.\u201d There was a world of sarcasm\r\nin his voice as he spoke. \u201cIf you will let me know how your\r\ninvestigations go,\u201d he continued, \u201cI shall be happy to give you any\r\nhelp I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who\r\nfound the body. Can you give me his name and address?\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade glanced at his note-book. \u201cJohn Rance,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is off\r\nduty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes took a note of the address.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome along, Doctor,\u201d he said; \u201cwe shall go and look him up. I\u2019ll tell\r\nyou one thing which may help you in the case,\u201d he continued, turning to\r\nthe two detectives. \u201cThere has been murder done, and the murderer was a\r\nman. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had\r\nsmall feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a\r\nTrichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,\r\nwhich was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his\r\noff fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and\r\nthe finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only\r\na few indications, but they may assist you.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf this man was murdered, how was it done?\u201d asked the former.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoison,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. \u201cOne other\r\nthing, Lestrade,\u201d he added, turning round at the door: \u201c\u2018Rache,\u2019 is the\r\nGerman for \u2018revenge;\u2019 so don\u2019t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals\r\nopen-mouthed behind him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nWHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one o\u2019clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock\r\nHolmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a\r\nlong telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us\r\nto the address given us by Lestrade.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is nothing like first hand evidence,\u201d he remarked; \u201cas a matter\r\nof fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as\r\nwell learn all that is to be learned.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou amaze me, Holmes,\u201d said I. \u201cSurely you are not as sure as you\r\npretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no room for a mistake,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe very first thing\r\nwhich I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts\r\nwith its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had\r\nno rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep\r\nimpression must have been there during the night. There were the marks\r\nof the horse\u2019s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more\r\nclearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new\r\nshoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there\r\nat any time during the morning\u2014I have Gregson\u2019s word for that\u2014it\r\nfollows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore,\r\nthat it brought those two individuals to the house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat seems simple enough,\u201d said I; \u201cbut how about the other man\u2019s\r\nheight?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from\r\nthe length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though\r\nthere is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow\u2019s stride\r\nboth on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of\r\nchecking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct\r\nleads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing\r\nwas just over six feet from the ground. It was child\u2019s play.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd his age?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest\r\neffort, he can\u2019t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth\r\nof a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across.\r\nPatent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.\r\nThere is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary\r\nlife a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I\r\nadvocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe finger nails and the Trichinopoly,\u201d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe writing on the wall was done with a man\u2019s forefinger dipped in\r\nblood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly\r\nscratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man\u2019s\r\nnail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor.\r\nIt was dark in colour and flakey\u2014such an ash as is only made by a\r\nTrichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes\u2014in fact, I\r\nhave written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can\r\ndistinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or\r\nof tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective\r\ndiffers from the Gregson and Lestrade type.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the florid face?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was\r\nright. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.\u201d\r\n\r\nI passed my hand over my brow. \u201cMy head is in a whirl,\u201d I remarked;\r\n\u201cthe more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these\r\ntwo men\u2014if there were two men\u2014into an empty house? What has become of\r\nthe cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take\r\npoison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the\r\nmurderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman\u2019s ring\r\nthere? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word\r\nRACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of\r\nreconciling all these facts.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy companion smiled approvingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,\u201d he\r\nsaid. \u201cThere is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up\r\nmy mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade\u2019s discovery it was\r\nsimply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by\r\nsuggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German.\r\nThe A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion.\r\nNow, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we\r\nmay safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy\r\nimitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry\r\ninto a wrong channel. I\u2019m not going to tell you much more of the case,\r\nDoctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained\r\nhis trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will\r\ncome to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall never do that,\u201d I answered; \u201cyou have brought detection as\r\nnear an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way\r\nin which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as\r\nsensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of\r\nher beauty.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one other thing,\u201d he said. \u201cPatent-leathers and\r\nSquare-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway\r\ntogether as friendly as possible\u2014arm-in-arm, in all probability. When\r\nthey got inside they walked up and down the room\u2014or rather,\r\nPatent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I\r\ncould read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he\r\ngrew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of\r\nhis strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no\r\ndoubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I\u2019ve told you all I know\r\nmyself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good\r\nworking basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want\r\nto go to Halle\u2019s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way\r\nthrough a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the\r\ndingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Audley Court in there,\u201d he said, pointing to a narrow slit in\r\nthe line of dead-coloured brick. \u201cYou\u2019ll find me here when you come\r\nback.\u201d\r\n\r\nAudley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us\r\ninto a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We\r\npicked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of\r\ndiscoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was\r\ndecorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was\r\nengraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we\r\nwere shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.\r\n\r\nHe appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in\r\nhis slumbers. \u201cI made my report at the office,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nHolmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it\r\npensively. \u201cWe thought that we should like to hear it all from your own\r\nlips,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,\u201d the constable\r\nanswered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.\u201d\r\n\r\nRance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though\r\ndetermined not to omit anything in his narrative.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell it ye from the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cMy time is from ten at\r\nnight to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the \u2018White\r\nHart\u2019; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o\u2019clock it\r\nbegan to rain, and I met Harry Murcher\u2014him who has the Holland Grove\r\nbeat\u2014and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin\u2019.\r\nPresently\u2014maybe about two or a little after\u2014I thought I would take a\r\nlook round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was\r\nprecious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down,\r\nthough a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin\u2019 down, thinkin\u2019\r\nbetween ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when\r\nsuddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same\r\nhouse. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty\r\non account of him that owns them who won\u2019t have the drains seen to,\r\nthough the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o\u2019 typhoid\r\nfever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the\r\nwindow, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the\r\ndoor\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,\u201d my companion\r\ninterrupted. \u201cWhat did you do that for?\u201d\r\n\r\nRance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the\r\nutmost amazement upon his features.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that\u2019s true, sir,\u201d he said; \u201cthough how you come to know it,\r\nHeaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still\r\nand so lonesome, that I thought I\u2019d be none the worse for some one with\r\nme. I ain\u2019t afeared of anything on this side o\u2019 the grave; but I\r\nthought that maybe it was him that died o\u2019 the typhoid inspecting the\r\ndrains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o\u2019 turn, and I\r\nwalked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher\u2019s lantern, but\r\nthere wasn\u2019t no sign of him nor of anyone else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was no one in the street?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a livin\u2019 soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself\r\ntogether and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside,\r\nso I went into the room where the light was a-burnin\u2019. There was a\r\ncandle flickerin\u2019 on the mantelpiece\u2014a red wax one\u2014and by its light I\r\nsaw\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times,\r\nand you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried\r\nthe kitchen door, and then\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in\r\nhis eyes. \u201cWhere was you hid to see all that?\u201d he cried. \u201cIt seems to\r\nme that you knows a deal more than you should.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get arresting me for the murder,\u201d he said. \u201cI am one of the\r\nhounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for\r\nthat. Go on, though. What did you do next?\u201d\r\n\r\nRance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified\r\nexpression. \u201cI went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That\r\nbrought Murcher and two more to the spot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas the street empty then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe constable\u2019s features broadened into a grin. \u201cI\u2019ve seen many a drunk\r\nchap in my time,\u201d he said, \u201cbut never anyone so cryin\u2019 drunk as that\r\ncove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin\u2019 up agin the\r\nrailings, and a-singin\u2019 at the pitch o\u2019 his lungs about Columbine\u2019s\r\nNew-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn\u2019t stand, far less\r\nhelp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat sort of a man was he?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\nJohn Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. \u201cHe\r\nwas an uncommon drunk sort o\u2019 man,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019d ha\u2019 found hisself in\r\nthe station if we hadn\u2019t been so took up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis face\u2014his dress\u2014didn\u2019t you notice them?\u201d Holmes broke in\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up\u2014me\r\nand Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower\r\npart muffled round\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d cried Holmes. \u201cWhat became of him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019d enough to do without lookin\u2019 after him,\u201d the policeman said, in\r\nan aggrieved voice. \u201cI\u2019ll wager he found his way home all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow was he dressed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA brown overcoat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad he a whip in his hand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA whip\u2014no.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe must have left it behind,\u201d muttered my companion. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\r\nhappen to see or hear a cab after that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a half-sovereign for you,\u201d my companion said, standing up and\r\ntaking his hat. \u201cI am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the\r\nforce. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You\r\nmight have gained your sergeant\u2019s stripes last night. The man whom you\r\nheld in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and\r\nwhom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell\r\nyou that it is so. Come along, Doctor.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous,\r\nbut obviously uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe blundering fool,\u201d Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our\r\nlodgings. \u201cJust to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good\r\nluck, and not taking advantage of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this\r\nman tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why\r\nshould he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way\r\nof criminals.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no\r\nother way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I\r\nshall have him, Doctor\u2014I\u2019ll lay you two to one that I have him. I must\r\nthank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have\r\nmissed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh? Why\r\nshouldn\u2019t we use a little art jargon. There\u2019s the scarlet thread of\r\nmurder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to\r\nunravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now for\r\nlunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing are\r\nsplendid. What\u2019s that little thing of Chopin\u2019s she plays so\r\nmagnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.\u201d\r\n\r\nLeaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a\r\nlark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nOUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur morning\u2019s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was\r\ntired out in the afternoon. After Holmes\u2019 departure for the concert, I\r\nlay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours\u2019 sleep.\r\nIt was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that\r\nhad occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it.\r\nEvery time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted\r\nbaboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the\r\nimpression which that face had produced upon me that I found it\r\ndifficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its\r\nowner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most\r\nmalignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of\r\nCleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the\r\ndepravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law.\r\n\r\nThe more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion\u2019s\r\nhypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he\r\nhad sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something\r\nwhich had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had\r\ncaused the man\u2019s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of\r\nstrangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay\r\nso thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had\r\nthe victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist.\r\nAs long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would\r\nbe no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet\r\nself-confident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory\r\nwhich explained all the facts, though what it was I could not for an\r\ninstant conjecture.\r\n\r\nHe was very late in returning\u2014so late, that I knew that the concert\r\ncould not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table\r\nbefore he appeared.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was magnificent,\u201d he said, as he took his seat. \u201cDo you remember\r\nwhat Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and\r\nappreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of\r\nspeech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced\r\nby it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries\r\nwhen the world was in its childhood.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s rather a broad idea,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne\u2019s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret\r\nNature,\u201d he answered. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You\u2019re not looking quite\r\nyourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo tell the truth, it has,\u201d I said. \u201cI ought to be more case-hardened\r\nafter my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at\r\nMaiwand without losing my nerve.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\r\nimagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you\r\nseen the evening paper?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the\r\nfact that when the man was raised up, a woman\u2019s wedding ring fell upon\r\nthe floor. It is just as well it does not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at this advertisement,\u201d he answered. \u201cI had one sent to every\r\npaper this morning immediately after the affair.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated.\r\nIt was the first announcement in the \u201cFound\u201d column. \u201cIn Brixton Road,\r\nthis morning,\u201d it ran, \u201ca plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway\r\nbetween the \u2018White Hart\u2019 Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson,\r\n221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse my using your name,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I used my own some of these\r\ndunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is all right,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut supposing anyone applies, I have\r\nno ring.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes, you have,\u201d said he, handing me one. \u201cThis will do very well.\r\nIt is almost a facsimile.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who do you expect will answer this advertisement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, the man in the brown coat\u2014our florid friend with the square toes.\r\nIf he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould he not consider it as too dangerous?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason\r\nto believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose\r\nthe ring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over\r\nDrebber\u2019s body, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the\r\nhouse he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police\r\nalready in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle\r\nburning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions\r\nwhich might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put\r\nyourself in that man\u2019s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have\r\noccurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the\r\nroad after leaving the house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly\r\nlook out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the\r\narticles found. His eye, of course, would light upon this. He would be\r\noverjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There would be no reason in his\r\neyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder.\r\nHe would come. He will come. You shall see him within an hour?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and\r\nthough I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for\r\nanything.\u201d\r\n\r\nI went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the\r\npistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his\r\nfavourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe plot thickens,\u201d he said, as I entered; \u201cI have just had an answer\r\nto my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that is?\u201d I asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy fiddle would be the better for new strings,\u201d he remarked. \u201cPut your\r\npistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an\r\nordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don\u2019t frighten him by looking at\r\nhim too hard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is eight o\u2019clock now,\u201d I said, glancing at my watch.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door\r\nslightly. That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This\r\nis a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday\u2014\u2018De Jure inter\r\nGentes\u2019\u2014published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles\u2019\r\nhead was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed\r\nvolume was struck off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is the printer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPhilippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very\r\nfaded ink, is written \u2018Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.\u2019 I wonder who William\r\nWhyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His\r\nwriting has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose\r\nsoftly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the\r\nservant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she\r\nopened it.\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes Dr. Watson live here?\u201d asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We\r\ncould not hear the servant\u2019s reply, but the door closed, and some one\r\nbegan to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling\r\none. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he\r\nlistened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a\r\nfeeble tap at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in,\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\nAt my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very\r\nold and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be\r\ndazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she\r\nstood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket\r\nwith nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face\r\nhad assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do\r\nto keep my countenance.\r\n\r\nThe old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our\r\nadvertisement. \u201cIt\u2019s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,\u201d she said,\r\ndropping another curtsey; \u201ca gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It\r\nbelongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth,\r\nwhich her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he\u2019d say if\r\nhe come \u2018ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think,\r\nhe being short enough at the best o\u2019 times, but more especially when he\r\nhas the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night\r\nalong with\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that her ring?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Lord be thanked!\u201d cried the old woman; \u201cSally will be a glad woman\r\nthis night. That\u2019s the ring.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what may your address be?\u201d I inquired, taking up a pencil.\r\n\r\n\u201c13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,\u201d\r\nsaid Sherlock Holmes sharply.\r\n\r\nThe old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little\r\nred-rimmed eyes. \u201cThe gentleman asked me for _my_ address,\u201d she said.\r\n\u201cSally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your name is\u2014\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Sawyer\u2014her\u2019s is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her\u2014and a\r\nsmart, clean lad, too, as long as he\u2019s at sea, and no steward in the\r\ncompany more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and\r\nwhat with liquor shops\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,\u201d I interrupted, in obedience to a sign\r\nfrom my companion; \u201cit clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad\r\nto be able to restore it to the rightful owner.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old\r\ncrone packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs.\r\nSherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and\r\nrushed into his room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an\r\nulster and a cravat. \u201cI\u2019ll follow her,\u201d he said, hurriedly; \u201cshe must\r\nbe an accomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.\u201d The hall\r\ndoor had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended\r\nthe stair. Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly\r\nalong the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance\r\nbehind. \u201cEither his whole theory is incorrect,\u201d I thought to myself,\r\n\u201cor else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery.\u201d There was no\r\nneed for him to ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was\r\nimpossible until I heard the result of his adventure.\r\n\r\nIt was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might\r\nbe, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages\r\nof Henri Murger\u2019s \u201cVie de Boh\u00e8me.\u201d Ten o\u2019clock passed, and I heard the\r\nfootsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the more\r\nstately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same\r\ndestination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of\r\nhis latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not\r\nbeen successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the\r\nmastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a\r\nhearty laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,\u201d he cried,\r\ndropping into his chair; \u201cI have chaffed them so much that they would\r\nnever have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I\r\nknow that I will be even with them in the long run.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind telling a story against myself. That creature had\r\ngone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being\r\nfoot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler\r\nwhich was passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the\r\naddress, but I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud\r\nenough to be heard at the other side of the street, \u2018Drive to 13,\r\nDuncan Street, Houndsditch,\u2019 she cried. This begins to look genuine, I\r\nthought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind.\r\nThat\u2019s an art which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away\r\nwe rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in\r\nquestion. I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down\r\nthe street in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver\r\njumped down, and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing\r\ncame out though. When I reached him he was groping about frantically in\r\nthe empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of\r\noaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or trace of his\r\npassenger, and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare. On\r\ninquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a\r\nrespectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name\r\neither of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say,\u201d I cried, in amazement, \u201cthat that tottering,\r\nfeeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion,\r\nwithout either you or the driver seeing her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOld woman be damned!\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. \u201cWe were the old\r\nwomen to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active\r\none, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was\r\ninimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means\r\nof giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is not as\r\nlonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk\r\nsomething for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my advice\r\nand turn in.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I left\r\nHolmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the\r\nwatches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his\r\nviolin, and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem\r\nwhich he had set himself to unravel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nTOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe papers next day were full of the \u201cBrixton Mystery,\u201d as they termed\r\nit. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it\r\nin addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I\r\nstill retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing\r\nupon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:\u2014\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had\r\nseldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German\r\nname of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister\r\ninscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political\r\nrefugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in\r\nAmerica, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten\r\nlaws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the\r\nVehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers,\r\nthe Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff\r\nHighway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government\r\nand advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.\r\n\r\nThe _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the\r\nsort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from\r\nthe unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening\r\nof all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been\r\nresiding for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the\r\nboarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell.\r\nHe was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph\r\nStangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th\r\ninst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of\r\ncatching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon\r\nthe platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber\u2019s body\r\nwas, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road,\r\nmany miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are\r\nquestions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the\r\nwhereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and\r\nMr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it\r\nis confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily\r\nthrow light upon the matter.\r\n\r\nThe _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being\r\na political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated\r\nthe Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores\r\na number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not\r\nsoured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these\r\nmen there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was\r\npunished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary,\r\nStangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the\r\ndeceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address\r\nof the house at which he had boarded\u2014a result which was entirely due to\r\nthe acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast,\r\nand they appeared to afford him considerable amusement.\r\n\r\n\u201cI told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure\r\nto score.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat depends on how it turns out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, bless you, it doesn\u2019t matter in the least. If the man is caught,\r\nit will be _on account_ of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be\r\n_in spite_ of their exertions. It\u2019s heads I win and tails you lose.\r\nWhatever they do, they will have followers. \u2018Un sot trouve toujours un\r\nplus sot qui l\u2019admire.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth is this?\u201d I cried, for at this moment there came the\r\npattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by\r\naudible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Baker Street division of the detective police force,\u201d said my\r\ncompanion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a\r\ndozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped\r\neyes on.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tention!\u201d cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little\r\nscoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. \u201cIn\r\nfuture you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you\r\nmust wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, we hain\u2019t,\u201d said one of the youths.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are\r\nyour wages.\u201d He handed each of them a shilling.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many\r\nrats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than\r\nout of a dozen of the force,\u201d Holmes remarked. \u201cThe mere sight of an\r\nofficial-looking person seals men\u2019s lips. These youngsters, however, go\r\neverywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all\r\nthey want is organisation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter\r\nof time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance!\r\nHere is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every\r\nfeature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There\r\nhe is!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the\r\nfair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and\r\nburst into our sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d he cried, wringing Holmes\u2019 unresponsive hand,\r\n\u201ccongratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.\u201d\r\n\r\nA shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion\u2019s expressive\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean that you are on the right track?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd his name is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cArthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty\u2019s navy,\u201d cried\r\nGregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake a seat, and try one of these cigars,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are anxious to\r\nknow how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d the detective answered. \u201cThe tremendous\r\nexertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have\r\nworn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain\r\nupon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we\r\nare both brain-workers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do me too much honour,\u201d said Holmes, gravely. \u201cLet us hear how you\r\narrived at this most gratifying result.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently\r\nat his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fun of it is,\u201d he cried, \u201cthat that fool Lestrade, who thinks\r\nhimself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is\r\nafter the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime\r\nthan the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this\r\ntime.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did you get your clue?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, I\u2019ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is\r\nstrictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to\r\ncontend with was the finding of this American\u2019s antecedents. Some\r\npeople would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or\r\nuntil parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not\r\nTobias Gregson\u2019s way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the\r\ndead man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cby John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.\u201d\r\n\r\nGregson looked quite crest-fallen.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had no idea that you noticed that,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you been there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; \u201cyou should never neglect a\r\nchance, however small it may seem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo a great mind, nothing is little,\u201d remarked Holmes, sententiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that\r\nsize and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once.\r\nHe had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier\u2019s\r\nBoarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSmart\u2014very smart!\u201d murmured Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI next called upon Madame Charpentier,\u201d continued the detective. \u201cI\r\nfound her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room,\r\ntoo\u2014an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about the\r\neyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn\u2019t escape my\r\nnotice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock\r\nHolmes, when you come upon the right scent\u2014a kind of thrill in your\r\nnerves. \u2018Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder\r\nMr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe mother nodded. She didn\u2019t seem able to get out a word. The\r\ndaughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew\r\nsomething of the matter.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018At what o\u2019clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?\u2019 I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018At eight o\u2019clock,\u2019 she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her\r\nagitation. \u2018His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two\r\ntrains\u2014one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And was that the last which you saw of him?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cA terrible change came over the woman\u2019s face as I asked the question.\r\nHer features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she\r\ncould get out the single word \u2018Yes\u2019\u2014and when it did come it was in a\r\nhusky unnatural tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm\r\nclear voice.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,\u2019 she said. \u2018Let us be\r\nfrank with this gentleman. We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018God forgive you!\u2019 cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and\r\nsinking back in her chair. \u2018You have murdered your brother.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,\u2019 the girl answered\r\nfirmly.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You had best tell me all about it now,\u2019 I said. \u2018Half-confidences are\r\nworse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018On your head be it, Alice!\u2019 cried her mother; and then, turning to\r\nme, \u2018I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on\r\nbehalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in\r\nthis terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is,\r\nhowever, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to\r\nbe compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character,\r\nhis profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,\u2019 I answered.\r\n\u2018Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,\u2019 she said, and her\r\ndaughter withdrew. \u2018Now, sir,\u2019 she continued, \u2018I had no intention of\r\ntelling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I\r\nhave no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all\r\nwithout omitting any particular.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is your wisest course,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his\r\nsecretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I\r\nnoticed a \u201cCopenhagen\u201d label upon each of their trunks, showing that\r\nthat had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet\r\nreserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise.\r\nHe was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night of\r\nhis arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after\r\ntwelve o\u2019clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His\r\nmanners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar.\r\nWorst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my\r\ndaughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which,\r\nfortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one occasion he\r\nactually seized her in his arms and embraced her\u2014an outrage which\r\ncaused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But why did you stand all this,\u2019 I asked. \u2018I suppose that you can get\r\nrid of your boarders when you wish.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. \u2018Would to God that\r\nI had given him notice on the very day that he came,\u2019 she said. \u2018But it\r\nwas a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each\u2014fourteen\r\npounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy\r\nin the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for\r\nthe best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to\r\nleave on account of it. That was the reason of his going.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave\r\njust now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper\r\nis violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed\r\nthe door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in\r\nless than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr.\r\nDrebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for\r\ndrink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my\r\ndaughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his\r\ntrain. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to\r\nher that she should fly with him. \u201cYou are of age,\u201d he said, \u201cand there\r\nis no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the\r\nold girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live\r\nlike a princess.\u201d Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away\r\nfrom him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her\r\ntowards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came\r\ninto the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the\r\nconfused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head.\r\nWhen I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with\r\na stick in his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think that fine fellow will trouble us\r\nagain,\u201d he said. \u201cI will just go after him and see what he does with\r\nhimself.\u201d With those words he took his hat and started off down the\r\nstreet. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber\u2019s mysterious death.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThis statement came from Mrs. Charpentier\u2019s lips with many gasps and\r\npauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words.\r\nI made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there\r\nshould be no possibility of a mistake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite exciting,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. \u201cWhat\r\nhappened next?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen Mrs. Charpentier paused,\u201d the detective continued, \u201cI saw that\r\nthe whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way\r\nwhich I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her\r\nson returned.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I do not know,\u2019 she answered.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Not know?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018After you went to bed?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018When did you go to bed?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018About eleven.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018So your son was gone at least two hours?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Possibly four or five?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What was he doing during that time?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I do not know,\u2019 she answered, turning white to her very lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out\r\nwhere Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and\r\narrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come\r\nquietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, \u2018I suppose you are\r\narresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel\r\nDrebber,\u2019 he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his\r\nalluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as\r\nhaving with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is your theory, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton\r\nRoad. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course\r\nof which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the\r\nstomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night\r\nwas so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of\r\nhis victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and\r\nthe writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks\r\nto throw the police on to the wrong scent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell done!\u201d said Holmes in an encouraging voice. \u201cReally, Gregson, you\r\nare getting along. We shall make something of you yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,\u201d the detective\r\nanswered proudly. \u201cThe young man volunteered a statement, in which he\r\nsaid that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him,\r\nand took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an\r\nold shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this\r\nold shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I\r\nthink the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is\r\nto think of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am\r\nafraid he won\u2019t make much of it. Why, by Jove, here\u2019s the very man\r\nhimself!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were\r\ntalking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness\r\nwhich generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting.\r\nHis face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged\r\nand untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with\r\nSherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be\r\nembarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling\r\nnervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. \u201cThis is a most\r\nextraordinary case,\u201d he said at last\u2014\u201ca most incomprehensible affair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!\u201d cried Gregson, triumphantly. \u201cI\r\nthought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the\r\nSecretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,\u201d said Lestrade gravely, \u201cwas\r\nmurdered at Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel about six o\u2019clock this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nLIGHT IN THE DARKNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so\r\nunexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. Gregson sprang\r\nout of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I\r\nstared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and\r\nhis brows drawn down over his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cStangerson too!\u201d he muttered. \u201cThe plot thickens.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was quite thick enough before,\u201d grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair.\r\n\u201cI seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you\u2014are you sure of this piece of intelligence?\u201d stammered\r\nGregson.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have just come from his room,\u201d said Lestrade. \u201cI was the first to\r\ndiscover what had occurred.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have been hearing Gregson\u2019s view of the matter,\u201d Holmes observed.\r\n\u201cWould you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no objection,\u201d Lestrade answered, seating himself. \u201cI freely\r\nconfess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the\r\ndeath of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was\r\ncompletely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out\r\nwhat had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston\r\nStation about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in\r\nthe morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question\r\nwhich confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed\r\nbetween 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him\r\nafterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the\r\nman, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then\r\nset to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the\r\nvicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion\r\nhad become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put\r\nup somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the\r\nstation again next morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,\u201d\r\nremarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making\r\nenquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and\r\nat eight o\u2019clock I reached Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, in Little George\r\nStreet. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there,\r\nthey at once answered me in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,\u2019 they said. \u2018He\r\nhas been waiting for a gentleman for two days.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where is he now?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I will go up and see him at once,\u2019 I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and\r\nlead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me\r\nthe room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor\r\nleading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about\r\nto go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish,\r\nin spite of my twenty years\u2019 experience. From under the door there\r\ncurled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the\r\npassage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side.\r\nI gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he\r\nsaw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to\r\nit, and knocked it in. The window of the room was open, and beside the\r\nwindow, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was\r\nquite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and\r\ncold. When we turned him over, the Boots recognized him at once as\r\nbeing the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of\r\nJoseph Stangerson. The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side,\r\nwhich must have penetrated the heart. And now comes the strangest part\r\nof the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror,\r\neven before Sherlock Holmes answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe word RACHE, written in letters of blood,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was it,\u201d said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all\r\nsilent for a while.\r\n\r\nThere was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the\r\ndeeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to\r\nhis crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle\r\ntingled as I thought of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man was seen,\u201d continued Lestrade. \u201cA milk boy, passing on his way\r\nto the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews\r\nat the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay\r\nthere, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which\r\nwas wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the\r\nladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to\r\nbe some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular\r\nnotice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for\r\nhim to be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a\r\nreddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have\r\nstayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found\r\nblood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and\r\nmarks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.\u201d\r\n\r\nI glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which\r\ntallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of\r\nexultation or satisfaction upon his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the\r\nmurderer?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing. Stangerson had Drebber\u2019s purse in his pocket, but it seems\r\nthat this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd\r\npounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these\r\nextraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were\r\nno papers or memoranda in the murdered man\u2019s pocket, except a single\r\ntelegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the\r\nwords, \u2018J. H. is in Europe.\u2019 There was no name appended to this\r\nmessage.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd there was nothing else?\u201d Holmes asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing of any importance. The man\u2019s novel, with which he had read\r\nhimself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair\r\nbeside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the\r\nwindow-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe last link,\u201d he cried, exultantly. \u201cMy case is complete.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two detectives stared at him in amazement.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have now in my hands,\u201d my companion said, confidently, \u201call the\r\nthreads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details\r\nto be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the\r\ntime that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the\r\ndiscovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own\r\neyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand\r\nupon those pills?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have them,\u201d said Lestrade, producing a small white box; \u201cI took them\r\nand the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place\r\nof safety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking\r\nthese pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance\r\nto them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive them here,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cNow, Doctor,\u201d turning to me, \u201care those\r\nordinary pills?\u201d\r\n\r\nThey certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small,\r\nround, and almost transparent against the light. \u201cFrom their lightness\r\nand transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,\u201d I\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so,\u201d answered Holmes. \u201cNow would you mind going down and\r\nfetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so\r\nlong, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain\r\nyesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\nI went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms. Its laboured\r\nbreathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end.\r\nIndeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded\r\nthe usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the\r\nrug.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will now cut one of these pills in two,\u201d said Holmes, and drawing\r\nhis penknife he suited the action to the word. \u201cOne half we return into\r\nthe box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine\r\nglass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our\r\nfriend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis may be very interesting,\u201d said Lestrade, in the injured tone of\r\none who suspects that he is being laughed at, \u201cI cannot see, however,\r\nwhat it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPatience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has\r\neverything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the\r\nmixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps\r\nit up readily enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and\r\nplaced it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock\r\nHolmes\u2019 earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in\r\nsilence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling\r\neffect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched\r\nupon the cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently neither\r\nthe better nor the worse for its draught.\r\n\r\nHolmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without\r\nresult, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared\r\nupon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the\r\ntable, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was\r\nhis emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two\r\ndetectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check\r\nwhich he had met.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be a coincidence,\u201d he cried, at last springing from his chair\r\nand pacing wildly up and down the room; \u201cit is impossible that it\r\nshould be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the\r\ncase of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And\r\nyet they are inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of\r\nreasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this\r\nwretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have it!\u201d With a\r\nperfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in\r\ntwo, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The\r\nunfortunate creature\u2019s tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in\r\nit before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid\r\nand lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his\r\nforehead. \u201cI should have more faith,\u201d he said; \u201cI ought to know by this\r\ntime that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of\r\ndeductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other\r\ninterpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly\r\npoison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that\r\nbefore ever I saw the box at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could\r\nhardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog,\r\nhowever, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me\r\nthat the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began\r\nto have a dim, vague perception of the truth.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll this seems strange to you,\u201d continued Holmes, \u201cbecause you failed\r\nat the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single\r\nreal clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize\r\nupon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to\r\nconfirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence\r\nof it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more\r\nobscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions.\r\nIt is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most\r\ncommonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no\r\nnew or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder\r\nwould have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of\r\nthe victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those\r\n_outr\u00e9_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it\r\nremarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more\r\ndifficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable\r\nimpatience, could contain himself no longer. \u201cLook here, Mr. Sherlock\r\nHolmes,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart\r\nman, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something\r\nmore than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking\r\nthe man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young\r\nCharpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade\r\nwent after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too.\r\nYou have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more\r\nthan we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to\r\nask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the\r\nman who did it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,\u201d remarked Lestrade.\r\n\u201cWe have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more\r\nthan once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence\r\nwhich you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAny delay in arresting the assassin,\u201d I observed, \u201cmight give him time\r\nto perpetrate some fresh atrocity.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He\r\ncontinued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest\r\nand his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere will be no more murders,\u201d he said at last, stopping abruptly and\r\nfacing us. \u201cYou can put that consideration out of the question. You\r\nhave asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere\r\nknowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power\r\nof laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have\r\ngood hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a\r\nthing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate\r\nman to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by\r\nanother who is as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea\r\nthat anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but\r\nif he had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish\r\nin an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city.\r\nWithout meaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that\r\nI consider these men to be more than a match for the official force,\r\nand that is why I have not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of\r\ncourse, incur all the blame due to this omission; but that I am\r\nprepared for. At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I\r\ncan communicate with you without endangering my own combinations, I\r\nshall do so.\u201d\r\n\r\nGregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance,\r\nor by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had\r\nflushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other\u2019s beady\r\neyes glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time\r\nto speak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the\r\nspokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his\r\ninsignificant and unsavoury person.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease, sir,\u201d he said, touching his forelock, \u201cI have the cab\r\ndownstairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d said Holmes, blandly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you introduce this pattern\r\nat Scotland Yard?\u201d he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from\r\na drawer. \u201cSee how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an\r\ninstant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe old pattern is good enough,\u201d remarked Lestrade, \u201cif we can only\r\nfind the man to put them on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good, very good,\u201d said Holmes, smiling. \u201cThe cabman may as well\r\nhelp me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about\r\nto set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it.\r\nThere was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and\r\nbegan to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust give me a help with this buckle, cabman,\u201d he said, kneeling over\r\nhis task, and never turning his head.\r\n\r\nThe fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put\r\ndown his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the\r\njangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.\r\n\r\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d he cried, with flashing eyes, \u201clet me introduce you to Mr.\r\nJefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph\r\nStangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe whole thing occurred in a moment\u2014so quickly that I had no time to\r\nrealize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes\u2019\r\ntriumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman\u2019s dazed,\r\nsavage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had\r\nappeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might\r\nhave been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury,\r\nthe prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes\u2019s grasp, and hurled\r\nhimself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but\r\nbefore he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon\r\nhim like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and\r\nthen commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he,\r\nthat the four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to\r\nhave the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and\r\nhands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss\r\nof blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until\r\nLestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and\r\nhalf-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of\r\nno avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his\r\nfeet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless\r\nand panting.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have his cab,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cIt will serve to take him to\r\nScotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,\u201d he continued, with a pleasant\r\nsmile, \u201cwe have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very\r\nwelcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no\r\ndanger that I will refuse to answer them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n_The Country of the Saints._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies\r\nan arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a\r\nbarrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to\r\nNebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado\r\nupon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature\r\nalways in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises\r\nsnow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are\r\nswift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged ca\u00f1ons; and there are\r\nenormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are\r\ngrey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the\r\ncommon characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.\r\n\r\nThere are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or\r\nof Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other\r\nhunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight\r\nof those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their\r\nprairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily\r\nthrough the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark\r\nravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks.\r\nThese are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nIn the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the\r\nnorthern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach\r\nstretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of\r\nalkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On\r\nthe extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks,\r\nwith their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of\r\ncountry there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life.\r\nThere is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull,\r\ngrey earth\u2014above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may,\r\nthere is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing\r\nbut silence\u2014complete and heart-subduing silence.\r\n\r\nIt has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad\r\nplain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one\r\nsees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is\r\nlost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down\r\nby the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered\r\nwhite objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull\r\ndeposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some\r\nlarge and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have\r\nbelonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one\r\nmay trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of\r\nthose who had fallen by the wayside.\r\n\r\nLooking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,\r\neighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance\r\nwas such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the\r\nregion. An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was\r\nnearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the\r\nbrown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones;\r\nhis long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white;\r\nhis eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre;\r\nwhile the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that\r\nof a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and\r\nyet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a\r\nwiry and vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his\r\nclothes, which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed\r\nwhat it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man\r\nwas dying\u2014dying from hunger and from thirst.\r\n\r\nHe had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little\r\nelevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the\r\ngreat salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of\r\nsavage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might\r\nindicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there\r\nwas no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild\r\nquestioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to\r\nan end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. \u201cWhy\r\nnot here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,\u201d he\r\nmuttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.\r\n\r\nBefore sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless\r\nrifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had\r\ncarried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too\r\nheavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground\r\nwith some little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a\r\nlittle moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face,\r\nwith very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve hurt me!\u201d said a childish voice reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave I though,\u201d the man answered penitently, \u201cI didn\u2019t go for to do\r\nit.\u201d As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty\r\nlittle girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart\r\npink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother\u2019s care. The\r\nchild was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she\r\nhad suffered less than her companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is it now?\u201d he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the\r\ntowsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cKiss it and make it well,\u201d she said, with perfect gravity, showing the\r\ninjured part up to him. \u201cThat\u2019s what mother used to do. Where\u2019s\r\nmother?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMother\u2019s gone. I guess you\u2019ll see her before long.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGone, eh!\u201d said the little girl. \u201cFunny, she didn\u2019t say good-bye; she\r\n\u2018most always did if she was just goin\u2019 over to Auntie\u2019s for tea, and\r\nnow she\u2019s been away three days. Say, it\u2019s awful dry, ain\u2019t it? Ain\u2019t\r\nthere no water, nor nothing to eat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, there ain\u2019t nothing, dearie. You\u2019ll just need to be patient\r\nawhile, and then you\u2019ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like\r\nthat, and then you\u2019ll feel bullier. It ain\u2019t easy to talk when your\r\nlips is like leather, but I guess I\u2019d best let you know how the cards\r\nlie. What\u2019s that you\u2019ve got?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPretty things! fine things!\u201d cried the little girl enthusiastically,\r\nholding up two glittering fragments of mica. \u201cWhen we goes back to home\r\nI\u2019ll give them to brother Bob.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see prettier things than them soon,\u201d said the man confidently.\r\n\u201cYou just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though\u2014you remember when\r\nwe left the river?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we reckoned we\u2019d strike another river soon, d\u2019ye see. But there\r\nwas somethin\u2019 wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin\u2019, and it didn\u2019t\r\nturn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you\r\nand\u2014and\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t wash yourself,\u201d interrupted his companion gravely,\r\nstaring up at his grimy visage.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian\r\nPete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie,\r\nyour mother.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen mother\u2019s a deader too,\u201d cried the little girl dropping her face\r\nin her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some\r\nchance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and\r\nwe tramped it together. It don\u2019t seem as though we\u2019ve improved matters.\r\nThere\u2019s an almighty small chance for us now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean that we are going to die too?\u201d asked the child, checking\r\nher sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s about the size of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so before?\u201d she said, laughing gleefully. \u201cYou gave\r\nme such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we\u2019ll be with\r\nmother again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, you will, dearie.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you too. I\u2019ll tell her how awful good you\u2019ve been. I\u2019ll bet she\r\nmeets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot\r\nof buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was\r\nfond of. How long will it be first?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014not very long.\u201d The man\u2019s eyes were fixed upon the\r\nnorthern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared\r\nthree little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly\r\ndid they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large\r\nbrown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and\r\nthen settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards,\r\nthe vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.\r\n\r\n\u201cCocks and hens,\u201d cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their\r\nill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. \u201cSay, did\r\nGod make this country?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn course He did,\u201d said her companion, rather startled by this\r\nunexpected question.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,\u201d the\r\nlittle girl continued. \u201cI guess somebody else made the country in these\r\nparts. It\u2019s not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the\r\ntrees.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat would ye think of offering up prayer?\u201d the man asked diffidently.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t night yet,\u201d she answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt don\u2019t matter. It ain\u2019t quite regular, but He won\u2019t mind that, you\r\nbet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the\r\nwaggon when we was on the Plains.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you say some yourself?\u201d the child asked, with wondering\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI disremember them,\u201d he answered. \u201cI hain\u2019t said none since I was half\r\nthe height o\u2019 that gun. I guess it\u2019s never too late. You say them out,\r\nand I\u2019ll stand by and come in on the choruses.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll need to kneel down, and me too,\u201d she said, laying the\r\nshawl out for that purpose. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put your hands up like this.\r\nIt makes you feel kind o\u2019 good.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see\r\nit. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the\r\nlittle prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her\r\nchubby face, and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the\r\ncloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom\r\nthey were face to face, while the two voices\u2014the one thin and clear,\r\nthe other deep and harsh\u2014united in the entreaty for mercy and\r\nforgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow\r\nof the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad\r\nbreast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but\r\nNature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights\r\nhe had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids\r\ndrooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the\r\nbreast, until the man\u2019s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses\r\nof his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.\r\n\r\nHad the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight\r\nwould have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali\r\nplain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and\r\nhardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but\r\ngradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid,\r\nwell-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it\r\nbecame evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of\r\nmoving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to\r\nthe conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon\r\nthe prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in\r\nthese arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary\r\nbluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered\r\ntilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up\r\nthrough the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great\r\ncaravan upon its journey for the West. But what a caravan! When the\r\nhead of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet\r\nvisible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched the\r\nstraggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot.\r\nInnumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who\r\ntoddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white\r\ncoverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but\r\nrather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of\r\ncircumstances to seek themselves a new country. There rose through the\r\nclear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of\r\nhumanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud\r\nas it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced\r\nmen, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On\r\nreaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council\r\namong themselves.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe wells are to the right, my brothers,\u201d said one, a hard-lipped,\r\nclean-shaven man with grizzly hair.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the right of the Sierra Blanco\u2014so we shall reach the Rio Grande,\u201d\r\nsaid another.\r\n\r\n\u201cFear not for water,\u201d cried a third. \u201cHe who could draw it from the\r\nrocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAmen! Amen!\u201d responded the whole party.\r\n\r\nThey were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and\r\nkeenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag\r\nabove them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink,\r\nshowing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight\r\nthere was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while\r\nfresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word\r\n\u2018Redskins\u2019 was on every lip.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere can\u2019t be any number of Injuns here,\u201d said the elderly man who\r\nappeared to be in command. \u201cWe have passed the Pawnees, and there are\r\nno other tribes until we cross the great mountains.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,\u201d asked one of the\r\nband.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I,\u201d \u201cand I,\u201d cried a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n\u201cLeave your horses below and we will await you here,\u201d the Elder\r\nanswered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their\r\nhorses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the\r\nobject which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and\r\nnoiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts. The\r\nwatchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock\r\nuntil their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who\r\nhad first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw\r\nhim throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on\r\njoining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met\r\ntheir eyes.\r\n\r\nOn the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a\r\nsingle giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man,\r\nlong-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His\r\nplacid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep.\r\nBeside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his\r\nbrown sinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast\r\nof his velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular\r\nline of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her\r\ninfantile features. Her plump little white legs terminating in white\r\nsocks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast\r\nto the long shrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock\r\nabove this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at\r\nthe sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment\r\nand flapped sullenly away.\r\n\r\nThe cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about\r\nthem in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down\r\nupon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him,\r\nand which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts.\r\nHis face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he\r\npassed his boney hand over his eyes. \u201cThis is what they call delirium,\r\nI guess,\u201d he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the\r\nskirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the\r\nwondering questioning gaze of childhood.\r\n\r\nThe rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways\r\nthat their appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little\r\ngirl, and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her\r\ngaunt companion, and assisted him towards the waggons.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is John Ferrier,\u201d the wanderer explained; \u201cme and that little\r\nun are all that\u2019s left o\u2019 twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o\u2019\r\nthirst and hunger away down in the south.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs she your child?\u201d asked someone.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess she is now,\u201d the other cried, defiantly; \u201cshe\u2019s mine \u2018cause I\r\nsaved her. No man will take her from me. She\u2019s Lucy Ferrier from this\r\nday on. Who are you, though?\u201d he continued, glancing with curiosity at\r\nhis stalwart, sunburned rescuers; \u201cthere seems to be a powerful lot of\r\nye.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNigh upon ten thousand,\u201d said one of the young men; \u201cwe are the\r\npersecuted children of God\u2014the chosen of the Angel Merona.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never heard tell on him,\u201d said the wanderer. \u201cHe appears to have\r\nchosen a fair crowd of ye.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not jest at that which is sacred,\u201d said the other sternly. \u201cWe are\r\nof those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian\r\nletters on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy\r\nJoseph Smith at Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of\r\nIllinois, where we had founded our temple. We have come to seek a\r\nrefuge from the violent man and from the godless, even though it be the\r\nheart of the desert.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. \u201cI\r\nsee,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are the Mormons.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are the Mormons,\u201d answered his companions with one voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd where are you going?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our\r\nProphet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded\r\nby crowds of the pilgrims\u2014pale-faced meek-looking women, strong\r\nlaughing children, and anxious earnest-eyed men. Many were the cries of\r\nastonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they\r\nperceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the\r\nother. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a\r\ngreat crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was\r\nconspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of\r\nits appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were\r\nfurnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there\r\nsat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but\r\nwhose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He\r\nwas reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid\r\nit aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then\r\nhe turned to the two castaways.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we take you with us,\u201d he said, in solemn words, \u201cit can only be as\r\nbelievers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better\r\nfar that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you\r\nshould prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts\r\nthe whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGuess I\u2019ll come with you on any terms,\u201d said Ferrier, with such\r\nemphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader\r\nalone retained his stern, impressive expression.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake him, Brother Stangerson,\u201d he said, \u201cgive him food and drink, and\r\nthe child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy\r\ncreed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn, on to Zion!\u201d cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled\r\ndown the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away\r\nin a dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a\r\ncreaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the\r\nwhole caravan was winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the\r\ntwo waifs had been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was\r\nalready awaiting them.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shall remain here,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a few days you will have\r\nrecovered from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and\r\nfor ever you are of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has\r\nspoken with the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nTHE FLOWER OF UTAH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured\r\nby the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From\r\nthe shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky\r\nMountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in\r\nhistory. The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue,\r\nand disease\u2014every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had\r\nall been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and\r\nthe accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among\r\nthem. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt\r\nprayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight\r\nbeneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was\r\nthe promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for\r\nevermore.\r\n\r\nYoung speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as\r\na resolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the\r\nfuture city was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and\r\nallotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. The\r\ntradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the\r\ntown streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country\r\nthere was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next\r\nsummer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything\r\nprospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple which\r\nthey had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger.\r\nFrom the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the\r\nclatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the\r\nmonument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe\r\nthrough many dangers.\r\n\r\nThe two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his\r\nfortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons\r\nto the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne\r\nalong pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson\u2019s waggon, a retreat which\r\nshe shared with the Mormon\u2019s three wives and with his son, a headstrong\r\nforward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of\r\nchildhood, from the shock caused by her mother\u2019s death, she soon became\r\na pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her\r\nmoving canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered\r\nfrom his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an\r\nindefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new\r\ncompanions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was\r\nunanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as\r\nfertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of\r\nYoung himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who\r\nwere the four principal Elders.\r\n\r\nOn the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial\r\nlog-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it\r\ngrew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen\r\nin his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution\r\nenabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his\r\nlands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him\r\nprospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his\r\nneighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in\r\ntwelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City\r\nwho could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant\r\nWahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John\r\nFerrier.\r\n\r\nThere was one way and only one in which he offended the\r\nsusceptibilities of his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion\r\ncould ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner\r\nof his companions. He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal,\r\nbut contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his\r\ndetermination. There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his\r\nadopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and\r\nreluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early love\r\naffair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of\r\nthe Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate.\r\nIn every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young\r\nsettlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and\r\nstraight-walking man.\r\n\r\nLucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted\r\nfather in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the\r\nbalsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to\r\nthe young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger,\r\nher cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon\r\nthe high road which ran by Ferrier\u2019s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts\r\nrevive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping\r\nthrough the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father\u2019s mustang,\r\nand managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the\r\nWest. So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her\r\nfather the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of\r\nAmerican girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.\r\n\r\nIt was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had\r\ndeveloped into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious\r\nchange is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of\r\nall does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the\r\ntouch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns,\r\nwith a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has\r\nawoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and\r\nremember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life.\r\nIn the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself,\r\napart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many\r\nbesides.\r\n\r\nIt was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as\r\nthe bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields\r\nand in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty\r\nhigh roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to\r\nthe west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the\r\nOverland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were\r\ndroves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands,\r\nand trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their\r\ninterminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her\r\nway with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy\r\nFerrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut\r\nhair floating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in\r\nthe City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with\r\nall the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was\r\nto be performed. The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in\r\nastonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with\r\ntheir pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at\r\nthe beauty of the pale-faced maiden.\r\n\r\nShe had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road\r\nblocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking\r\nherdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass\r\nthis obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap.\r\nScarcely had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed\r\nin behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving\r\nstream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to\r\ndeal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took\r\nadvantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of\r\npushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one\r\nof the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact\r\nwith the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant\r\nit reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and\r\ntossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider.\r\nThe situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse\r\nbrought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It\r\nwas all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a\r\nslip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and\r\nterrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began\r\nto swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising\r\ncloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might\r\nhave abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her\r\nelbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy\r\nbrown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way\r\nthrough the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not hurt, I hope, miss,\u201d said her preserver, respectfully.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. \u201cI\u2019m awful\r\nfrightened,\u201d she said, naively; \u201cwhoever would have thought that Poncho\r\nwould have been so scared by a lot of cows?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank God you kept your seat,\u201d the other said earnestly. He was a\r\ntall, savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse,\r\nand clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over\r\nhis shoulders. \u201cI guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,\u201d he\r\nremarked, \u201cI saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask\r\nhim if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he\u2019s the same\r\nFerrier, my father and he were pretty thick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHadn\u2019t you better come and ask yourself?\u201d she asked, demurely.\r\n\r\nThe young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes\r\nsparkled with pleasure. \u201cI\u2019ll do so,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve been in the\r\nmountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting\r\ncondition. He must take us as he finds us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,\u201d she answered,\r\n\u201che\u2019s awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he\u2019d have never\r\ngot over it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNeither would I,\u201d said her companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou! Well, I don\u2019t see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow.\r\nYou ain\u2019t even a friend of ours.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young hunter\u2019s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy\r\nFerrier laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, I didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d she said; \u201cof course, you are a friend\r\nnow. You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won\u2019t\r\ntrust me with his business any more. Good-bye!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye,\u201d he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over\r\nher little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her\r\nriding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nYoung Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn.\r\nHe and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver,\r\nand were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital\r\nenough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as\r\nkeen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had\r\ndrawn his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young\r\ngirl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his\r\nvolcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from\r\nhis sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that\r\nneither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of\r\nsuch importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one. The love\r\nwhich had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy\r\nof a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will\r\nand imperious temper. He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he\r\nundertook. He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if\r\nhuman effort and human perseverance could render him successful.\r\n\r\nHe called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his\r\nface was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the\r\nvalley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the\r\nnews of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this\r\nJefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested\r\nLucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and\r\ncould narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in\r\nthose wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a\r\nsilver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to\r\nbe had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became\r\na favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues.\r\nOn such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her\r\nbright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no\r\nlonger her own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms,\r\nbut they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nIt was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled\r\nup at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He\r\nthrew the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am off, Lucy,\u201d he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing\r\ntenderly down into her face; \u201cI won\u2019t ask you to come with me now, but\r\nwill you be ready to come when I am here again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd when will that be?\u201d she asked, blushing and laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cA couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my\r\ndarling. There\u2019s no one who can stand between us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how about father?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all\r\nright. I have no fear on that head.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there\u2019s\r\nno more to be said,\u201d she whispered, with her cheek against his broad\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank God!\u201d he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. \u201cIt is\r\nsettled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are\r\nwaiting for me at the ca\u00f1on. Good-bye, my own darling\u2014good-bye. In two\r\nmonths you shall see me.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his\r\nhorse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though\r\nafraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what\r\nhe was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he\r\nvanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the\r\nhappiest girl in all Utah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nJOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had\r\ndeparted from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier\u2019s heart was sore within him\r\nwhen he thought of the young man\u2019s return, and of the impending loss of\r\nhis adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the\r\narrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always\r\ndetermined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever\r\ninduce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he\r\nregarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever\r\nhe might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was\r\ninflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to\r\nexpress an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in\r\nthe Land of the Saints.\r\n\r\nYes, a dangerous matter\u2014so dangerous that even the most saintly dared\r\nonly whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something\r\nwhich fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a\r\nswift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned\r\npersecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most terrible\r\ndescription. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German\r\nVehmgericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put\r\na more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over\r\nthe State of Utah.\r\n\r\nIts invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this\r\norganization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and\r\nomnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out\r\nagainst the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or\r\nwhat had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home,\r\nbut no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands\r\nof his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed by\r\nannihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this\r\nterrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men went\r\nabout in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the\r\nwilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.\r\n\r\nAt first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the\r\nrecalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards\r\nto pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The\r\nsupply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female\r\npopulation on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange\r\nrumours began to be bandied about\u2014rumours of murdered immigrants and\r\nrifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women\r\nappeared in the harems of the Elders\u2014women who pined and wept, and bore\r\nupon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated\r\nwanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked,\r\nstealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These\r\ntales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and\r\nre-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.\r\nTo this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite\r\nBand, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.\r\n\r\nFuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible\r\nresults served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it\r\ninspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless\r\nsociety. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and\r\nviolence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.\r\nThe very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the\r\nProphet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at\r\nnight with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every\r\nman feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were\r\nnearest his heart.\r\n\r\nOne fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields,\r\nwhen he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window,\r\nsaw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His\r\nheart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great\r\nBrigham Young himself. Full of trepidation\u2014for he knew that such a\r\nvisit boded him little good\u2014Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon\r\nchief. The latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and\r\nfollowed him with a stern face into the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrother Ferrier,\u201d he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly\r\nfrom under his light-coloured eyelashes, \u201cthe true believers have been\r\ngood friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the\r\ndesert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley,\r\ngave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our\r\nprotection. Is not this so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is so,\u201d answered John Ferrier.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you\r\nshould embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages.\r\nThis you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you\r\nhave neglected.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how have I neglected it?\u201d asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in\r\nexpostulation. \u201cHave I not given to the common fund? Have I not\r\nattended at the Temple? Have I not\u2014\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere are your wives?\u201d asked Young, looking round him. \u201cCall them in,\r\nthat I may greet them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true that I have not married,\u201d Ferrier answered. \u201cBut women were\r\nfew, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a\r\nlonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is of that daughter that I would speak to you,\u201d said the leader of\r\nthe Mormons. \u201cShe has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found\r\nfavour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn Ferrier groaned internally.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve\u2014stories that\r\nshe is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues.\r\nWhat is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith?\r\n\u2018Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if she\r\nwed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.\u2019 This being so, it is\r\nimpossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your\r\ndaughter to violate it.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his\r\nriding-whip.\r\n\r\n\u201cUpon this one point your whole faith shall be tested\u2014so it has been\r\ndecided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would\r\nnot have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all\r\nchoice. We Elders have many heifers,[1] but our children must also be\r\nprovided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of\r\nthem would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose\r\nbetween them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say\r\nyou to that?\u201d\r\n\r\n    [1] Heber C. Kemball, in one of his sermons, alludes to his hundred\r\n    wives under this endearing epithet.\r\n\r\nFerrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will give us time,\u201d he said at last. \u201cMy daughter is very\r\nyoung\u2014she is scarce of an age to marry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe shall have a month to choose,\u201d said Young, rising from his seat.\r\n\u201cAt the end of that time she shall give her answer.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and\r\nflashing eyes. \u201cIt were better for you, John Ferrier,\u201d he thundered,\r\n\u201cthat you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra\r\nBlanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of\r\nthe Holy Four!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and\r\nFerrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.\r\n\r\nHe was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he\r\nshould broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon\r\nhis, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her\r\npale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI could not help it,\u201d she said, in answer to his look. \u201cHis voice rang\r\nthrough the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you scare yourself,\u201d he answered, drawing her to him, and\r\npassing his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair.\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll fix it up somehow or another. You don\u2019t find your fancy kind o\u2019\r\nlessening for this chap, do you?\u201d\r\n\r\nA sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; of course not. I shouldn\u2019t care to hear you say you did. He\u2019s a\r\nlikely lad, and he\u2019s a Christian, which is more than these folk here,\r\nin spite o\u2019 all their praying and preaching. There\u2019s a party starting\r\nfor Nevada to-morrow, and I\u2019ll manage to send him a message letting him\r\nknow the hole we are in. If I know anything o\u2019 that young man, he\u2019ll be\r\nback here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.\u201d\r\n\r\nLucy laughed through her tears at her father\u2019s description.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that\r\nI am frightened, dear. One hears\u2014one hears such dreadful stories about\r\nthose who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to\r\nthem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we haven\u2019t opposed him yet,\u201d her father answered. \u201cIt will be time\r\nto look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at\r\nthe end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLeave Utah!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s about the size of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the farm?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell\r\nthe truth, Lucy, it isn\u2019t the first time I have thought of doing it. I\r\ndon\u2019t care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their\r\ndarned prophet. I\u2019m a free-born American, and it\u2019s all new to me. Guess\r\nI\u2019m too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might\r\nchance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the\r\nopposite direction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut they won\u2019t let us leave,\u201d his daughter objected.\r\n\r\n\u201cWait till Jefferson comes, and we\u2019ll soon manage that. In the\r\nmeantime, don\u2019t you fret yourself, my dearie, and don\u2019t get your eyes\r\nswelled up, else he\u2019ll be walking into me when he sees you. There\u2019s\r\nnothing to be afeared about, and there\u2019s no danger at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone,\r\nbut she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the\r\nfastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and\r\nloaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nA FLIGHT FOR LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet,\r\nJohn Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his\r\nacquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him\r\nwith his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of the\r\nimminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he\r\nshould return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and\r\nreturned home with a lighter heart.\r\n\r\nAs he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to\r\neach of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering\r\nto find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a\r\nlong pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet\r\ncocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse\r\nbloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in\r\nhis pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as\r\nhe entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know us,\u201d he said. \u201cThis here is the son of Elder\r\nDrebber, and I\u2019m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the\r\ndesert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the\r\ntrue fold.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs He will all the nations in His own good time,\u201d said the other in a\r\nnasal voice; \u201cHe grindeth slowly but exceeding small.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have come,\u201d continued Stangerson, \u201cat the advice of our fathers to\r\nsolicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to\r\nyou and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has\r\nseven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, nay, Brother Stangerson,\u201d cried the other; \u201cthe question is not\r\nhow many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now\r\ngiven over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut my prospects are better,\u201d said the other, warmly. \u201cWhen the Lord\r\nremoves my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather\r\nfactory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will be for the maiden to decide,\u201d rejoined young Drebber, smirking\r\nat his own reflection in the glass. \u201cWe will leave it all to her\r\ndecision.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway,\r\nhardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here,\u201d he said at last, striding up to them, \u201cwhen my daughter\r\nsummons you, you can come, but until then I don\u2019t want to see your\r\nfaces again.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this\r\ncompetition between them for the maiden\u2019s hand was the highest of\r\nhonours both to her and her father.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are two ways out of the room,\u201d cried Ferrier; \u201cthere is the\r\ndoor, and there is the window. Which do you care to use?\u201d\r\n\r\nHis brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening,\r\nthat his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The\r\nold farmer followed them to the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me know when you have settled which it is to be,\u201d he said,\r\nsardonically.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shall smart for this!\u201d Stangerson cried, white with rage. \u201cYou\r\nhave defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to\r\nthe end of your days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,\u201d cried young Drebber;\r\n\u201cHe will arise and smite you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll start the smiting,\u201d exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would\r\nhave rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and\r\nrestrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses\u2019\r\nhoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe young canting rascals!\u201d he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from\r\nhis forehead; \u201cI would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the\r\nwife of either of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so should I, father,\u201d she answered, with spirit; \u201cbut Jefferson\r\nwill soon be here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for\r\nwe do not know what their next move may be.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and\r\nhelp should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted\r\ndaughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been\r\nsuch a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If\r\nminor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this\r\narch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no\r\navail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been\r\nspirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He\r\nwas a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which\r\nhung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this\r\nsuspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter,\r\nhowever, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she,\r\nwith the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.\r\n\r\nHe expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from\r\nYoung as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an\r\nunlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his\r\nsurprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed\r\njust over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cTwenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How\r\nthis warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his\r\nservants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been\r\nsecured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but\r\nthe incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were\r\nevidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What\r\nstrength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such\r\nmysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck\r\nhim to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.\r\n\r\nStill more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their\r\nbreakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the\r\ncentre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the\r\nnumber 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not\r\nenlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and\r\nward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27\r\nhad been painted upon the outside of his door.\r\n\r\nThus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his\r\nunseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some\r\nconspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the\r\nmonth of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls,\r\nsometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards\r\nstuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John\r\nFerrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A\r\nhorror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of\r\nthem. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled\r\nlook of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that\r\nwas for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada.\r\n\r\nTwenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news\r\nof the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there\r\ncame no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a\r\ndriver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking\r\nthat help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to\r\nfour and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of\r\nescape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains\r\nwhich surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The\r\nmore-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could\r\npass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he\r\nwould, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him.\r\nYet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life\r\nitself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter\u2019s\r\ndishonour.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles,\r\nand searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown\r\nthe figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the\r\nlast of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague\r\nand terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter\u2014what was\r\nto become of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the\r\ninvisible network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon\r\nthe table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.\r\n\r\nWhat was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound\u2014low,\r\nbut very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of\r\nthe house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was\r\na pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was\r\nrepeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the\r\npanels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry\r\nout the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent\r\nwho was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier\r\nfelt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook\r\nhis nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt\r\nand threw the door open.\r\n\r\nOutside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were\r\ntwinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the\r\nfarmer\u2019s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on\r\nthe road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier\r\nlooked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at\r\nhis own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face\r\nupon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.\r\n\r\nSo unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with\r\nhis hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first\r\nthought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying\r\nman, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into\r\nthe hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within\r\nthe house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to\r\nthe astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of\r\nJefferson Hope.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood God!\u201d gasped John Ferrier. \u201cHow you scared me! Whatever made you\r\ncome in like that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive me food,\u201d the other said, hoarsely. \u201cI have had no time for bite\r\nor sup for eight-and-forty hours.\u201d He flung himself upon the cold meat\r\nand bread which were still lying upon the table from his host\u2019s supper,\r\nand devoured it voraciously. \u201cDoes Lucy bear up well?\u201d he asked, when\r\nhe had satisfied his hunger.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. She does not know the danger,\u201d her father answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I\r\ncrawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they\u2019re not\r\nquite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a\r\ndevoted ally. He seized the young man\u2019s leathery hand and wrung it\r\ncordially. \u201cYou\u2019re a man to be proud of,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are not many\r\nwho would come to share our danger and our troubles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve hit it there, pard,\u201d the young hunter answered. \u201cI have a\r\nrespect for you, but if you were alone in this business I\u2019d think twice\r\nbefore I put my head into such a hornet\u2019s nest. It\u2019s Lucy that brings\r\nme here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o\u2019\r\nthe Hope family in Utah.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are we to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost.\r\nI have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much\r\nmoney have you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for\r\nCarson City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as\r\nwell that the servants do not sleep in the house.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching\r\njourney, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into\r\na small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by\r\nexperience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had\r\nhardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his\r\ndaughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the\r\nlovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was\r\nmuch to be done.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must make our start at once,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a\r\nlow but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the\r\nperil, but has steeled his heart to meet it. \u201cThe front and back\r\nentrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the\r\nside window and across the fields. Once on the road we are only two\r\nmiles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we\r\nshould be half-way through the mountains.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat if we are stopped,\u201d asked Ferrier.\r\n\r\nHope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his\r\ntunic. \u201cIf they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them\r\nwith us,\u201d he said with a sinister smile.\r\n\r\nThe lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the\r\ndarkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own,\r\nand which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved\r\nhimself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and\r\nhappiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes.\r\nAll looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad\r\nsilent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that the\r\nspirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set\r\nexpression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house\r\nhe had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.\r\n\r\nFerrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the\r\nscanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a\r\nfew of her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and\r\ncarefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the\r\nnight, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With\r\nbated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained\r\nthe shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap\r\nwhich opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when\r\nthe young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the\r\nshadow, where they lay silent and trembling.\r\n\r\nIt was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the\r\nears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the\r\nmelancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of\r\nthem, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small\r\ndistance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the\r\ngap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal\r\ncry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-morrow at midnight,\u201d said the first who appeared to be in\r\nauthority. \u201cWhen the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is well,\u201d returned the other. \u201cShall I tell Brother Drebber?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSeven to five!\u201d repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away\r\nin different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some\r\nform of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died\r\naway in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping\r\nhis companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the\r\ntop of his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her\r\nstrength appeared to fail her.\r\n\r\n\u201cHurry on! hurry on!\u201d he gasped from time to time. \u201cWe are through the\r\nline of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!\u201d\r\n\r\nOnce on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet\r\nanyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid\r\nrecognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a\r\nrugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged\r\npeaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led\r\nbetween them was the Eagle Ca\u00f1on in which the horses were awaiting\r\nthem. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the\r\ngreat boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he\r\ncame to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful\r\nanimals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old\r\nFerrier upon one of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson\r\nHope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path.\r\n\r\nIt was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face\r\nNature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a\r\nthousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic\r\ncolumns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified\r\nmonster. On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all\r\nadvance impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow\r\nin places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that\r\nonly practised riders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of\r\nall dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light\r\nwithin them, for every step increased the distance between them and the\r\nterrible despotism from which they were flying.\r\n\r\nThey soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the\r\njurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most\r\ndesolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and\r\npointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark\r\nand plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them\r\nas soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of \u201cWho goes\r\nthere?\u201d rang through the silent ravine.\r\n\r\n\u201cTravellers for Nevada,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the\r\nrifle which hung by his saddle.\r\n\r\nThey could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down\r\nat them as if dissatisfied at their reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy whose permission?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Holy Four,\u201d answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught\r\nhim that that was the highest authority to which he could refer.\r\n\r\n\u201cNine from seven,\u201d cried the sentinel.\r\n\r\n\u201cSeven from five,\u201d returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the\r\ncountersign which he had heard in the garden.\r\n\r\n\u201cPass, and the Lord go with you,\u201d said the voice from above. Beyond his\r\npost the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a\r\ntrot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon\r\nhis gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen\r\npeople, and that freedom lay before them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nTHE AVENGING ANGELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular\r\nand rock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope\u2019s\r\nintimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track\r\nonce more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage\r\nbeauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks\r\nhemmed them in, peeping over each other\u2019s shoulders to the far horizon.\r\nSo steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch\r\nand the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only\r\na gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear\r\nentirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with\r\ntrees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they\r\npassed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which\r\nwoke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses\r\ninto a gallop.\r\n\r\nAs the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great\r\nmountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until\r\nthey were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the\r\nhearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild\r\ntorrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered\r\ntheir horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her\r\nfather would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was\r\ninexorable. \u201cThey will be upon our track by this time,\u201d he said.\r\n\u201cEverything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for\r\nthe remainder of our lives.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and\r\nby evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from\r\ntheir enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag,\r\nwhere the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there\r\nhuddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours\u2019 sleep. Before\r\ndaybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had\r\nseen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that\r\nthey were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose\r\nenmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could\r\nreach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store\r\nof provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness,\r\nhowever, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had\r\nfrequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life.\r\nChoosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and\r\nmade a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for\r\nthey were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the\r\nair was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy\r\nadieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of\r\nwhatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man\r\nand the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three\r\nanimals stood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks\r\nhid them from his view.\r\n\r\nHe walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another\r\nwithout success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and\r\nother indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the\r\nvicinity. At last, after two or three hours\u2019 fruitless search, he was\r\nthinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he\r\nsaw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the\r\nedge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there\r\nstood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed\r\nwith a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn\u2014for so it is called\u2014was\r\nacting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to\r\nthe hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction,\r\nand had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon\r\na rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The\r\nanimal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the\r\nprecipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath.\r\n\r\nThe creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself\r\nwith cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy\r\nover his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening\r\nwas already drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he\r\nrealized the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had\r\nwandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no\r\neasy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in\r\nwhich he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which\r\nwere so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from\r\nthe other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a\r\nmountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before.\r\nConvinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with\r\nthe same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark\r\nbefore he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him.\r\nEven then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the\r\nmoon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the\r\nobscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from\r\nhis exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the\r\nreflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he\r\ncarried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nHe had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left\r\nthem. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs\r\nwhich bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously,\r\nfor he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart\r\nhe put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud\r\nhalloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an\r\nanswer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary\r\nsilent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless\r\nrepetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no\r\nwhisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time\r\nago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards\r\nfrantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation.\r\n\r\nWhen he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the\r\nfire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there,\r\nbut it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead\r\nsilence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to\r\nconvictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the\r\nremains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only\r\ntoo clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during\r\nhis absence\u2014a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no\r\ntraces behind it.\r\n\r\nBewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin\r\nround, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He\r\nwas essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from\r\nhis temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the\r\nsmouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help\r\nto examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet\r\nof horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the\r\nfugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had\r\nafterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of\r\nhis companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself\r\nthat they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which\r\nmade every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one\r\nside of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had\r\nassuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything\r\nbut a newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived\r\nthat a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the\r\ncleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the\r\npoint:\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN FERRIER,\r\nFORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY,\r\nDied August 4th, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone,\r\nthen, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round\r\nto see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy\r\nhad been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original\r\ndestiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder\u2019s son. As the young\r\nfellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to\r\nprevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in\r\nhis last silent resting-place.\r\n\r\nAgain, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs\r\nfrom despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least\r\ndevote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance,\r\nJefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness,\r\nwhich he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived.\r\nAs he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which\r\ncould assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution,\r\nbrought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring\r\nenergy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim,\r\nwhite face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and\r\nhaving stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him\r\nfor a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he\r\nset himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the\r\navenging angels.\r\n\r\nFor five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he\r\nhad already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down\r\namong the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak\r\nhe was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle\r\nCa\u00f1on, from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he\r\ncould look down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he\r\nleaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent\r\nwidespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that there\r\nwere flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of\r\nfestivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he\r\nheard the clatter of horse\u2019s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding\r\ntowards him. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named\r\nCowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. He\r\ntherefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of\r\nfinding out what Lucy Ferrier\u2019s fate had been.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Jefferson Hope,\u201d he said. \u201cYou remember me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment\u2014indeed, it was\r\ndifficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly\r\nwhite face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former\r\ndays. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity,\r\nthe man\u2019s surprise changed to consternation.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are mad to come here,\u201d he cried. \u201cIt is as much as my own life is\r\nworth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from\r\nthe Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t fear them, or their warrant,\u201d Hope said, earnestly. \u201cYou must\r\nknow something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you\r\nhold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For\r\nGod\u2019s sake, don\u2019t refuse to answer me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the Mormon asked uneasily. \u201cBe quick. The very rocks have\r\nears and the trees eyes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat has become of Lucy Ferrier?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you\r\nhave no life left in you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and\r\nhad sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. \u201cMarried,\r\nyou say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMarried yesterday\u2014that\u2019s what those flags are for on the Endowment\r\nHouse. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson\r\nas to which was to have her. They\u2019d both been in the party that\r\nfollowed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give\r\nhim the best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber\u2019s\r\nparty was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one\r\nwon\u2019t have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday.\r\nShe is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I am off,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His\r\nface might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its\r\nexpression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder,\r\nstrode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains\r\nto the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so\r\nfierce and so dangerous as himself.\r\n\r\nThe prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it\r\nwas the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful\r\nmarriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her\r\nhead again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish\r\nhusband, who had married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier\u2019s\r\nproperty, did not affect any great grief at his bereavement; but his\r\nother wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the night before the\r\nburial, as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in\r\nthe early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and\r\nastonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking,\r\nweather-beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room. Without a\r\nglance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white\r\nsilent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier.\r\nStooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead,\r\nand then, snatching up her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her\r\nfinger. \u201cShe shall not be buried in that,\u201d he cried with a fierce\r\nsnarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and\r\nwas gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that the watchers\r\nmight have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other\r\npeople of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet\r\nof gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared.\r\n\r\nFor some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a\r\nstrange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for\r\nvengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird\r\nfigure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the\r\nlonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson\u2019s\r\nwindow and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On\r\nanother occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder\r\ncrashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing\r\nhimself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in\r\ndiscovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led\r\nrepeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or\r\nkilling their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the\r\nprecaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having\r\ntheir houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these\r\nmeasures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and\r\nthey hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.\r\n\r\nFar from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter\u2019s mind\r\nwas of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge\r\nhad taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any\r\nother emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon\r\nrealized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant\r\nstrain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome\r\nfood were wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains,\r\nwhat was to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure\r\nto overtake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his\r\nenemy\u2019s game, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there\r\nto recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue\r\nhis object without privation.\r\n\r\nHis intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a\r\ncombination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines\r\nfor nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his\r\nwrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that\r\nmemorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier\u2019s grave. Disguised,\r\nand under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what\r\nbecame of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be\r\njustice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a\r\nschism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger\r\nmembers of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the\r\nElders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of\r\nthe malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had\r\nbeen Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone.\r\nRumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his\r\nproperty into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his\r\ncompanion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at\r\nall, however, as to their whereabouts.\r\n\r\nMany a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of\r\nrevenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never\r\nfaltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out\r\nby such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town\r\nthrough the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into\r\nyear, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human\r\nbloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he\r\nhad devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but\r\na glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that\r\nCleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He\r\nreturned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all\r\narranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window,\r\nhad recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his\r\neyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by\r\nStangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to\r\nhim that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and\r\nhatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into\r\ncustody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some\r\nweeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that\r\nDrebber\u2019s house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had\r\ndeparted for Europe.\r\n\r\nAgain the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred\r\nurged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and for\r\nsome time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his\r\napproaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in\r\nhim, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to city,\r\nworking his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the\r\nfugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris;\r\nand when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off\r\nfor Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for\r\nthey had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running\r\nthem to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than\r\nquote the old hunter\u2019s own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson\u2019s\r\nJournal, to which we are already under such obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nA CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur prisoner\u2019s furious resistance did not apparently indicate any\r\nferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself\r\npowerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that\r\nhe had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. \u201cI guess you\u2019re going to take\r\nme to the police-station,\u201d he remarked to Sherlock Holmes. \u201cMy cab\u2019s at\r\nthe door. If you\u2019ll loose my legs I\u2019ll walk down to it. I\u2019m not so\r\nlight to lift as I used to be.\u201d\r\n\r\nGregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this\r\nproposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at\r\nhis word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ankles.\r\nHe rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that they\r\nwere free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed\r\nhim, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark\r\nsunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was\r\nas formidable as his personal strength.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are\r\nthe man for it,\u201d he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my\r\nfellow-lodger. \u201cThe way you kept on my trail was a caution.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou had better come with me,\u201d said Holmes to the two detectives.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can drive you,\u201d said Lestrade.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have\r\ntaken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.\u201d\r\n\r\nI assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no\r\nattempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his,\r\nand we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse,\r\nand brought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered\r\ninto a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner\u2019s\r\nname and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged.\r\nThe official was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his\r\nduties in a dull mechanical way. \u201cThe prisoner will be put before the\r\nmagistrates in the course of the week,\u201d he said; \u201cin the mean time, Mr.\r\nJefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you\r\nthat your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a good deal to say,\u201d our prisoner said slowly. \u201cI want to\r\ntell you gentlemen all about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHadn\u2019t you better reserve that for your trial?\u201d asked the Inspector.\r\n\r\n\u201cI may never be tried,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou needn\u2019t look startled. It\r\nisn\u2019t suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?\u201d He turned his fierce\r\ndark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; I am,\u201d I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen put your hand here,\u201d he said, with a smile, motioning with his\r\nmanacled wrists towards his chest.\r\n\r\nI did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing\r\nand commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed\r\nto thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some\r\npowerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a\r\ndull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d I cried, \u201cyou have an aortic aneurism!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they call it,\u201d he said, placidly. \u201cI went to a Doctor last\r\nweek about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many\r\ndays passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from\r\nover-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I\u2019ve\r\ndone my work now, and I don\u2019t care how soon I go, but I should like to\r\nleave some account of the business behind me. I don\u2019t want to be\r\nremembered as a common cut-throat.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the\r\nadvisability of allowing him to tell his story.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?\u201d the former\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\u201cMost certainly there is,\u201d I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to\r\ntake his statement,\u201d said the Inspector. \u201cYou are at liberty, sir, to\r\ngive your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll sit down, with your leave,\u201d the prisoner said, suiting the action\r\nto the word. \u201cThis aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the\r\ntussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I\u2019m on the brink\r\nof the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is\r\nthe absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the\r\nfollowing remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical\r\nmanner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough.\r\nI can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had\r\naccess to Lestrade\u2019s note-book, in which the prisoner\u2019s words were\r\ntaken down exactly as they were uttered.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt don\u2019t much matter to you why I hated these men,\u201d he said; \u201cit\u2019s\r\nenough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings\u2014a father\r\nand a daughter\u2014and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives.\r\nAfter the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was\r\nimpossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I\r\nknew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge,\r\njury, and executioner all rolled into one. You\u2019d have done the same, if\r\nyou have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She\r\nwas forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over\r\nit. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his\r\ndying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts\r\nshould be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried it\r\nabout with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two\r\ncontinents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they\r\ncould not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing\r\nthat my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished,\r\nand by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to\r\nfollow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I\r\nfound that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and\r\nriding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner\u2019s\r\noffice, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to\r\nthe owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There\r\nwas seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The\r\nhardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the\r\nmazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had\r\na map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal\r\nhotels and stations, I got on pretty well.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were\r\nliving; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across\r\nthem. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other\r\nside of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at\r\nmy mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their\r\nrecognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my\r\nopportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about\r\nLondon, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my\r\ncab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they\r\ncould not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late at\r\nnight that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand\r\nwith my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay\r\nmy hand upon the men I wanted.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was\r\nsome chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone,\r\nand never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every\r\nday, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half\r\nthe time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them\r\nlate and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not\r\ndiscouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My\r\nonly fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon\r\nand leave my work undone.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the\r\nstreet was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to\r\ntheir door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time\r\nDrebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my\r\nhorse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I\r\nfeared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station\r\nthey got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on\r\nto the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the\r\nguard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for\r\nsome hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was\r\nrather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle\r\nthat I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said\r\nthat he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other\r\nwould wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated\r\nwith him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together.\r\nDrebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must\r\ngo alone. I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other\r\nburst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his\r\npaid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. On that\r\nthe Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him\r\nthat if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday\u2019s\r\nPrivate Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the\r\nplatform before eleven, and made his way out of the station.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my\r\nenemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but\r\nsingly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue\r\nprecipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction\r\nin vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that\r\nstrikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans\r\narranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who\r\nhad wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It\r\nchanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in\r\nlooking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one\r\nof them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned;\r\nbut in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate\r\nconstructed. By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this\r\ngreat city where I could rely upon being free from interruption. How to\r\nget Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to\r\nsolve.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying\r\nfor nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he\r\nstaggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a\r\nhansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close\r\nthat the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole\r\nway. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets,\r\nuntil, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in\r\nwhich he had boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in\r\nreturning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or\r\nso from the house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a\r\nglass of water, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.\u201d\r\n\r\nI handed him the glass, and he drank it down.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or\r\nmore, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside\r\nthe house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared,\r\none of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had\r\nnever seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they\r\ncame to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent\r\nhim half across the road. \u2018You hound,\u2019 he cried, shaking his stick at\r\nhim; \u2018I\u2019ll teach you to insult an honest girl!\u2019 He was so hot that I\r\nthink he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur\r\nstaggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He\r\nran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and\r\njumped in. \u2018Drive me to Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel,\u2019 said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that\r\nI feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove\r\nalong slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might\r\ntake him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane\r\nhave my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when\r\nhe solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again,\r\nand he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving\r\nword that I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time,\r\nand when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my\r\nown hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only\r\nhave been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself\r\nto do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life\r\nif he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I\r\nhave filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and\r\nsweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor\r\nwas lecturing on poisons, and he showed his students some alkaloid, as\r\nhe called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow\r\npoison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant\r\ndeath. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and\r\nwhen they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a\r\nfairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble\r\npills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without\r\nthe poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my\r\ngentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I\r\nate the pill that remained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good\r\ndeal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. From that day I had\r\nalways my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I\r\nwas to use them.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard\r\nand raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within\u2014so\r\nglad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you\r\ngentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty\r\nlong years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would\r\nunderstand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my\r\nnerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with\r\nexcitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy\r\nlooking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I\r\nsee you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on\r\neach side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the\r\ndripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber\r\nall huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, \u2018It\u2019s\r\ntime to get out,\u2019 I said.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018All right, cabby,\u2019 said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned,\r\nfor he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I\r\nhad to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little\r\ntop-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the\r\nfront room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the\r\ndaughter were walking in front of us.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s infernally dark,\u2019 said he, stamping about.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018We\u2019ll soon have a light,\u2019 I said, striking a match and putting it to\r\na wax candle which I had brought with me. \u2018Now, Enoch Drebber,\u2019 I\r\ncontinued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, \u2018who\r\nam I?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw\r\na horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which\r\nshowed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I\r\nsaw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered\r\nin his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and\r\nlaughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be\r\nsweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now\r\npossessed me.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You dog!\u2019 I said; \u2018I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.\r\nPetersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your\r\nwanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see\r\nto-morrow\u2019s sun rise.\u2019 He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I\r\ncould see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time.\r\nThe pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I\r\nwould have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my\r\nnose and relieved me.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?\u2019 I cried, locking the door,\r\nand shaking the key in his face. \u2018Punishment has been slow in coming,\r\nbut it has overtaken you at last.\u2019 I saw his coward lips tremble as I\r\nspoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Would you murder me?\u2019 he stammered.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018There is no murder,\u2019 I answered. \u2018Who talks of murdering a mad dog?\r\nWhat mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her\r\nslaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless\r\nharem.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It was not I who killed her father,\u2019 he cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But it was you who broke her innocent heart,\u2019 I shrieked, thrusting\r\nthe box before him. \u2018Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat.\r\nThere is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you\r\nleave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are\r\nruled by chance.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my\r\nknife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I\r\nswallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a\r\nminute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die.\r\nShall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first\r\nwarning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as\r\nI saw it, and held Lucy\u2019s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was\r\nbut for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of\r\npain contorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him,\r\nstaggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I\r\nturned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There\r\nwas no movement. He was dead!\r\n\r\n\u201cThe blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice\r\nof it. I don\u2019t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon\r\nthe wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the\r\npolice upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I\r\nremembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above\r\nhim, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret\r\nsocieties must have done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New\r\nYorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own\r\nblood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall. Then I walked\r\ndown to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the\r\nnight was still very wild. I had driven some distance when I put my\r\nhand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy\u2019s ring, and found\r\nthat it was not there. I was thunderstruck at this, for it was the only\r\nmemento that I had of her. Thinking that I might have dropped it when I\r\nstooped over Drebber\u2019s body, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side\r\nstreet, I went boldly up to the house\u2014for I was ready to dare anything\r\nrather than lose the ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into\r\nthe arms of a police-officer who was coming out, and only managed to\r\ndisarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was\r\nto do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier\u2019s debt. I\r\nknew that he was staying at Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, and I hung about\r\nall day, but he never came out. I fancy that he suspected something\r\nwhen Drebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was\r\nStangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off\r\nby staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which\r\nwas the window of his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage\r\nof some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so\r\nmade my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and\r\ntold him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he\r\nhad taken so long before. I described Drebber\u2019s death to him, and I\r\ngave him the same choice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at\r\nthe chance of safety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and\r\nflew at my throat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would\r\nhave been the same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed\r\nhis guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have little more to say, and it\u2019s as well, for I am about done up. I\r\nwent on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I\r\ncould save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the\r\nyard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called\r\nJefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at\r\n221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next\r\nthing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and\r\nas neatly shackled as ever I saw in my life. That\u2019s the whole of my\r\nstory, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that\r\nI am just as much an officer of justice as you are.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo thrilling had the man\u2019s narrative been, and his manner was so\r\nimpressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional\r\ndetectives, _blas\u00e9_ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to\r\nbe keenly interested in the man\u2019s story. When he finished we sat for\r\nsome minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of\r\nLestrade\u2019s pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is only one point on which I should like a little more\r\ninformation,\u201d Sherlock Holmes said at last. \u201cWho was your accomplice\r\nwho came for the ring which I advertised?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. \u201cI can tell my own secrets,\u201d\r\nhe said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t get other people into trouble. I saw your\r\nadvertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the\r\nring which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think\r\nyou\u2019ll own he did it smartly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a doubt of that,\u201d said Holmes heartily.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, gentlemen,\u201d the Inspector remarked gravely, \u201cthe forms of the law\r\nmust be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before\r\nthe magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I\r\nwill be responsible for him.\u201d He rang the bell as he spoke, and\r\nJefferson Hope was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and\r\nI made our way out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nTHE CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the\r\nThursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our\r\ntestimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson\r\nHope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be\r\nmeted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurism\r\nburst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the\r\ncell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able in\r\nhis dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\u201cGregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,\u201d Holmes remarked,\r\nas we chatted it over next evening. \u201cWhere will their grand\r\nadvertisement be now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that they had very much to do with his capture,\u201d I\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,\u201d returned my\r\ncompanion, bitterly. \u201cThe question is, what can you make people believe\r\nthat you have done. Never mind,\u201d he continued, more brightly, after a\r\npause. \u201cI would not have missed the investigation for anything. There\r\nhas been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there\r\nwere several most instructive points about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSimple!\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,\u201d said Sherlock\r\nHolmes, smiling at my surprise. \u201cThe proof of its intrinsic simplicity\r\nis, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was\r\nable to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have already explained to you that what is out of the common is\r\nusually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this\r\nsort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very\r\nuseful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise\r\nit much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason\r\nforwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who\r\ncan reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI confess,\u201d said I, \u201cthat I do not quite follow you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer.\r\nMost people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you\r\nwhat the result would be. They can put those events together in their\r\nminds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are\r\nfew people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to\r\nevolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led\r\nup to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning\r\nbackwards, or analytically.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find\r\neverything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the\r\ndifferent steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I\r\napproached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely\r\nfree from all impressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway,\r\nand there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks\r\nof a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during\r\nthe night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private\r\ncarriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler\r\nis considerably less wide than a gentleman\u2019s brougham.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden\r\npath, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable\r\nfor taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere\r\ntrampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its\r\nsurface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is\r\nso important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.\r\nHappily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has\r\nmade it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the\r\nconstables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first\r\npassed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been\r\nbefore the others, because in places their marks had been entirely\r\nobliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my\r\nsecond link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were\r\ntwo in number, one remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the\r\nlength of his stride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from\r\nthe small and elegant impression left by his boots.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My\r\nwell-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder,\r\nif murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man\u2019s person, but\r\nthe agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen\r\nhis fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or\r\nany sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon\r\ntheir features. Having sniffed the dead man\u2019s lips I detected a\r\nslightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had\r\npoison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon\r\nhim from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of\r\nexclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would\r\nmeet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The\r\nforcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in\r\ncriminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in\r\nMontpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not\r\nbeen the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics,\r\nthen, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I\r\nwas inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political\r\nassassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder\r\nhad, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator\r\nhad left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there\r\nall the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political\r\none, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription\r\nwas discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my\r\nopinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found,\r\nhowever, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to\r\nremind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point\r\nthat I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to\r\nCleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber\u2019s former career. He\r\nanswered, you remember, in the negative.\r\n\r\n\u201cI then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which\r\nconfirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer\u2019s height, and furnished\r\nme with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the\r\nlength of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there\r\nwere no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had\r\nburst from the murderer\u2019s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that\r\nthe track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom\r\nthat any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way\r\nthrough emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was\r\nprobably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\n\u201cHaving left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I\r\ntelegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry\r\nto the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The\r\nanswer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for\r\nthe protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson\r\nHope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that\r\nI held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to\r\nsecure the murderer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked\r\ninto the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven\r\nthe cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on\r\nin a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in\r\ncharge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside\r\nthe house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry\r\nout a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third\r\nperson, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to\r\ndog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to\r\nturn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible\r\nconclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the\r\nMetropolis.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased\r\nto be. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would\r\nbe likely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time\r\nat least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to\r\nsuppose that he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change\r\nhis name in a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore\r\norganized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically\r\nto every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that\r\nI wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of\r\nit, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was\r\nan incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in\r\nany case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into\r\npossession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised.\r\nYou see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break\r\nor flaw.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is wonderful!\u201d I cried. \u201cYour merits should be publicly recognized.\r\nYou should publish an account of the case. If you won\u2019t, I will for\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may do what you like, Doctor,\u201d he answered. \u201cSee here!\u201d he\r\ncontinued, handing a paper over to me, \u201clook at this!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was the _Echo_ for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed\r\nwas devoted to the case in question.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe public,\u201d it said, \u201chave lost a sensational treat through the\r\nsudden death of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr.\r\nEnoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case\r\nwill probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good\r\nauthority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic\r\nfeud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the\r\nvictims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and\r\nHope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the\r\ncase has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most\r\nstriking manner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will\r\nserve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle\r\ntheir feuds at home, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an\r\nopen secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to\r\nthe well-known Scotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson.\r\nThe man was apprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr.\r\nSherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in\r\nthe detective line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to\r\nattain to some degree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial\r\nof some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting\r\nrecognition of their services.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you so when we started?\u201d cried Sherlock Holmes with a\r\nlaugh. \u201cThat\u2019s the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a\r\ntestimonial!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d I answered, \u201cI have all the facts in my journal, and the\r\npublic shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself\r\ncontented by the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo\r\nIpse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A STUDY IN SCARLET ***\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Man, it\u2019s witchcraft! Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you get those names?\u201d\r\n For an instant I could have sworn that the faintest shadow of a smile flickered over the woman\u2019s lips.\r\n \u201cWatson, would you be afraid to sleep in the same room with a lunatic.\u201d\r\n \u201cIf your heart is as big as your body, and your soul as fine as your face, then I\u2019d ask for nothing better,\u201d said McMurdo.\r\n It was all he could do to keep himself from screaming out.\r\n \u201cOh, Jack, I implore you to give it up!\u201d\r\n \u201cNot a sound, for your lives!\u201d McMurdo whispered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\nThe Tragedy of Birlstone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I\r\nThe Warning\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI am inclined to think\u2014\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should do so,\u201d Sherlock Holmes remarked impatiently.\r\n\r\nI believe that I am one of the most long-suffering of mortals; but I\u2019ll\r\nadmit that I was annoyed at the sardonic interruption. \u201cReally,\r\nHolmes,\u201d said I severely, \u201cyou are a little trying at times.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any immediate\r\nanswer to my remonstrance. He leaned upon his hand, with his untasted\r\nbreakfast before him, and he stared at the slip of paper which he had\r\njust drawn from its envelope. Then he took the envelope itself, held it\r\nup to the light, and very carefully studied both the exterior and the\r\nflap.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is Porlock\u2019s writing,\u201d said he thoughtfully. \u201cI can hardly doubt\r\nthat it is Porlock\u2019s writing, though I have seen it only twice before.\r\nThe Greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive. But if it is\r\nPorlock, then it must be something of the very first importance.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was speaking to himself rather than to me; but my vexation\r\ndisappeared in the interest which the words awakened.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho then is Porlock?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cPorlock, Watson, is a nom-de-plume, a mere identification mark; but\r\nbehind it lies a shifty and evasive personality. In a former letter he\r\nfrankly informed me that the name was not his own, and defied me ever\r\nto trace him among the teeming millions of this great city. Porlock is\r\nimportant, not for himself, but for the great man with whom he is in\r\ntouch. Picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark, the jackal\r\nwith the lion\u2014anything that is insignificant in companionship with what\r\nis formidable: not only formidable, Watson, but sinister\u2014in the highest\r\ndegree sinister. That is where he comes within my purview. You have\r\nheard me speak of Professor Moriarty?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe famous scientific criminal, as famous among crooks as\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy blushes, Watson!\u201d Holmes murmured in a deprecating voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was about to say, as he is unknown to the public.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA touch! A distinct touch!\u201d cried Holmes. \u201cYou are developing a\r\ncertain unexpected vein of pawky humour, Watson, against which I must\r\nlearn to guard myself. But in calling Moriarty a criminal you are\r\nuttering libel in the eyes of the law\u2014and there lie the glory and the\r\nwonder of it! The greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of every\r\ndeviltry, the controlling brain of the underworld, a brain which might\r\nhave made or marred the destiny of nations\u2014that\u2019s the man! But so aloof\r\nis he from general suspicion, so immune from criticism, so admirable in\r\nhis management and self-effacement, that for those very words that you\r\nhave uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your year\u2019s\r\npension as a solatium for his wounded character. Is he not the\r\ncelebrated author of The Dynamics of an Asteroid, a book which ascends\r\nto such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there\r\nwas no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it? Is this a\r\nman to traduce? Foul-mouthed doctor and slandered professor\u2014such would\r\nbe your respective r\u00f4les! That\u2019s genius, Watson. But if I am spared by\r\nlesser men, our day will surely come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I be there to see!\u201d I exclaimed devoutly. \u201cBut you were speaking\r\nof this man Porlock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes\u2014the so-called Porlock is a link in the chain some little way\r\nfrom its great attachment. Porlock is not quite a sound link\u2014between\r\nourselves. He is the only flaw in that chain so far as I have been able\r\nto test it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut no chain is stronger than its weakest link.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly, my dear Watson! Hence the extreme importance of Porlock. Led\r\non by some rudimentary aspirations towards right, and encouraged by the\r\njudicious stimulation of an occasional ten-pound note sent to him by\r\ndevious methods, he has once or twice given me advance information\r\nwhich has been of value\u2014that highest value which anticipates and\r\nprevents rather than avenges crime. I cannot doubt that, if we had the\r\ncipher, we should find that this communication is of the nature that I\r\nindicate.\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain Holmes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate. I rose and,\r\nleaning over him, stared down at the curious inscription, which ran as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n534 C2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41 DOUGLAS 109 293 5 37 BIRLSTONE 26\r\nBIRLSTONE 9 47 171\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you make of it, Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is obviously an attempt to convey secret information.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn this instance, none at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you say \u2018in this instance\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause there are many ciphers which I would read as easily as I do\r\nthe apocrypha of the agony column: such crude devices amuse the\r\nintelligence without fatiguing it. But this is different. It is clearly\r\na reference to the words in a page of some book. Until I am told which\r\npage and which book I am powerless.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why \u2018Douglas\u2019 and \u2018Birlstone\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cClearly because those are words which were not contained in the page\r\nin question.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why has he not indicated the book?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour native shrewdness, my dear Watson, that innate cunning which is\r\nthe delight of your friends, would surely prevent you from inclosing\r\ncipher and message in the same envelope. Should it miscarry, you are\r\nundone. As it is, both have to go wrong before any harm comes from it.\r\nOur second post is now overdue, and I shall be surprised if it does not\r\nbring us either a further letter of explanation, or, as is more\r\nprobable, the very volume to which these figures refer.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes\u2019s calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the\r\nappearance of Billy, the page, with the very letter which we were\r\nexpecting.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe same writing,\u201d remarked Holmes, as he opened the envelope, \u201cand\r\nactually signed,\u201d he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the\r\nepistle. \u201cCome, we are getting on, Watson.\u201d His brow clouded, however,\r\nas he glanced over the contents.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me, this is very disappointing! I fear, Watson, that all our\r\nexpectations come to nothing. I trust that the man Porlock will come to\r\nno harm.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Dear Mr. Holmes,\u2019 he says, \u2018I will go no further in this matter. It\r\nis too dangerous\u2014he suspects me. I can see that he suspects me. He came\r\nto me quite unexpectedly after I had actually addressed this envelope\r\nwith the intention of sending you the key to the cipher. I was able to\r\ncover it up. If he had seen it, it would have gone hard with me. But I\r\nread suspicion in his eyes. Please burn the cipher message, which can\r\nnow be of no use to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018FRED PORLOCK.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nHolmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his\r\nfingers, and frowning, as he stared into the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter all,\u201d he said at last, \u201cthere may be nothing in it. It may be\r\nonly his guilty conscience. Knowing himself to be a traitor, he may\r\nhave read the accusation in the other\u2019s eyes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe other being, I presume, Professor Moriarty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo less! When any of that party talk about \u2018He\u2019 you know whom they\r\nmean. There is one predominant \u2018He\u2019 for all of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what can he do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum! That\u2019s a large question. When you have one of the first brains of\r\nEurope up against you, and all the powers of darkness at his back,\r\nthere are infinite possibilities. Anyhow, Friend Porlock is evidently\r\nscared out of his senses\u2014kindly compare the writing in the note to that\r\nupon its envelope; which was done, he tells us, before this ill-omened\r\nvisit. The one is clear and firm. The other hardly legible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did he write at all? Why did he not simply drop it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause he feared I would make some inquiry after him in that case,\r\nand possibly bring trouble on him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt,\u201d said I. \u201cOf course.\u201d I had picked up the original cipher\r\nmessage and was bending my brows over it. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty maddening to\r\nthink that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper, and\r\nthat it is beyond human power to penetrate it.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had pushed away his untasted breakfast and lit the\r\nunsavoury pipe which was the companion of his deepest meditations. \u201cI\r\nwonder!\u201d said he, leaning back and staring at the ceiling. \u201cPerhaps\r\nthere are points which have escaped your Machiavellian intellect. Let\r\nus consider the problem in the light of pure reason. This man\u2019s\r\nreference is to a book. That is our point of departure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA somewhat vague one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us see then if we can narrow it down. As I focus my mind upon it,\r\nit seems rather less impenetrable. What indications have we as to this\r\nbook?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well, it is surely not quite so bad as that. The cipher message\r\nbegins with a large 534, does it not? We may take it as a working\r\nhypothesis that 534 is the particular page to which the cipher refers.\r\nSo our book has already become a _large_ book, which is surely\r\nsomething gained. What other indications have we as to the nature of\r\nthis large book? The next sign is C2. What do you make of that,\r\nWatson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cChapter the second, no doubt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHardly that, Watson. You will, I am sure, agree with me that if the\r\npage be given, the number of the chapter is immaterial. Also that if\r\npage 534 finds us only in the second chapter, the length of the first\r\none must have been really intolerable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cColumn!\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrilliant, Watson. You are scintillating this morning. If it is not\r\ncolumn, then I am very much deceived. So now, you see, we begin to\r\nvisualize a large book printed in double columns which are each of a\r\nconsiderable length, since one of the words is numbered in the document\r\nas the two hundred and ninety-third. Have we reached the limits of what\r\nreason can supply?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear that we have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely you do yourself an injustice. One more coruscation, my dear\r\nWatson\u2014yet another brain-wave! Had the volume been an unusual one, he\r\nwould have sent it to me. Instead of that, he had intended, before his\r\nplans were nipped, to send me the clue in this envelope. He says so in\r\nhis note. This would seem to indicate that the book is one which he\r\nthought I would have no difficulty in finding for myself. He had it\u2014and\r\nhe imagined that I would have it, too. In short, Watson, it is a very\r\ncommon book.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat you say certainly sounds plausible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo we have contracted our field of search to a large book, printed in\r\ndouble columns and in common use.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Bible!\u201d I cried triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood, Watson, good! But not, if I may say so, quite good enough! Even\r\nif I accepted the compliment for myself I could hardly name any volume\r\nwhich would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of Moriarty\u2019s\r\nassociates. Besides, the editions of Holy Writ are so numerous that he\r\ncould hardly suppose that two copies would have the same pagination.\r\nThis is clearly a book which is standardized. He knows for certain that\r\nhis page 534 will exactly agree with my page 534.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut very few books would correspond with that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. Therein lies our salvation. Our search is narrowed down to\r\nstandardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBradshaw!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are difficulties, Watson. The vocabulary of Bradshaw is nervous\r\nand terse, but limited. The selection of words would hardly lend itself\r\nto the sending of general messages. We will eliminate Bradshaw. The\r\ndictionary is, I fear, inadmissible for the same reason. What then is\r\nleft?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn almanac!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent, Watson! I am very much mistaken if you have not touched the\r\nspot. An almanac! Let us consider the claims of Whitaker\u2019s Almanac. It\r\nis in common use. It has the requisite number of pages. It is in double\r\ncolumn. Though reserved in its earlier vocabulary, it becomes, if I\r\nremember right, quite garrulous towards the end.\u201d He picked the volume\r\nfrom his desk. \u201cHere is page 534, column two, a substantial block of\r\nprint dealing, I perceive, with the trade and resources of British\r\nIndia. Jot down the words, Watson! Number thirteen is \u2018Mahratta.\u2019 Not,\r\nI fear, a very auspicious beginning. Number one hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven is \u2018Government\u2019; which at least makes sense, though\r\nsomewhat irrelevant to ourselves and Professor Moriarty. Now let us try\r\nagain. What does the Mahratta government do? Alas! the next word is\r\n\u2018pig\u2019s-bristles.\u2019 We are undone, my good Watson! It is finished!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had spoken in jesting vein, but the twitching of his bushy eyebrows\r\nbespoke his disappointment and irritation. I sat helpless and unhappy,\r\nstaring into the fire. A long silence was broken by a sudden\r\nexclamation from Holmes, who dashed at a cupboard, from which he\r\nemerged with a second yellow-covered volume in his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe pay the price, Watson, for being too up-to-date!\u201d he cried. \u201cWe are\r\nbefore our time, and suffer the usual penalties. Being the seventh of\r\nJanuary, we have very properly laid in the new almanac. It is more than\r\nlikely that Porlock took his message from the old one. No doubt he\r\nwould have told us so had his letter of explanation been written. Now\r\nlet us see what page 534 has in store for us. Number thirteen is\r\n\u2018There,\u2019 which is much more promising. Number one hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven is \u2018is\u2019\u2014\u2018There is\u2019 \u201c\u2014Holmes\u2019s eyes were gleaming with\r\nexcitement, and his thin, nervous fingers twitched as he counted the\r\nwords\u2014\u201c\u2018danger.\u2019 Ha! Ha! Capital! Put that down, Watson. \u2018There is\r\ndanger\u2014may\u2014come\u2014very soon\u2014one.\u2019 Then we have the name\r\n\u2018Douglas\u2019\u2014\u2018rich\u2014country\u2014now\u2014at\r\nBirlstone\u2014House\u2014Birlstone\u2014confidence\u2014is\u2014pressing.\u2019 There, Watson! What\r\ndo you think of pure reason and its fruit? If the green-grocer had such\r\na thing as a laurel wreath, I should send Billy round for it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was staring at the strange message which I had scrawled, as he\r\ndeciphered it, upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a queer, scrambling way of expressing his meaning!\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, he has done quite remarkably well,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\u201cWhen you search a single column for words with which to express your\r\nmeaning, you can hardly expect to get everything you want. You are\r\nbound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent. The\r\npurport is perfectly clear. Some deviltry is intended against one\r\nDouglas, whoever he may be, residing as stated, a rich country\r\ngentleman. He is sure\u2014\u2018confidence\u2019 was as near as he could get to\r\n\u2018confident\u2019\u2014that it is pressing. There is our result\u2014and a very\r\nworkmanlike little bit of analysis it was!\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work,\r\neven as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which he\r\naspired. He was still chuckling over his success when Billy swung open\r\nthe door and Inspector MacDonald of Scotland Yard was ushered into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThose were the early days at the end of the \u201980\u2019s, when Alec MacDonald\r\nwas far from having attained the national fame which he has now\r\nachieved. He was a young but trusted member of the detective force, who\r\nhad distinguished himself in several cases which had been intrusted to\r\nhim. His tall, bony figure gave promise of exceptional physical\r\nstrength, while his great cranium and deep-set, lustrous eyes spoke no\r\nless clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled out from behind\r\nhis bushy eyebrows. He was a silent, precise man with a dour nature and\r\na hard Aberdonian accent.\r\n\r\nTwice already in his career had Holmes helped him to attain success,\r\nhis own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem. For this\r\nreason the affection and respect of the Scotchman for his amateur\r\ncolleague were profound, and he showed them by the frankness with which\r\nhe consulted Holmes in every difficulty. Mediocrity knows nothing\r\nhigher than itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius, and\r\nMacDonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to\r\nperceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of one\r\nwho already stood alone in Europe, both in his gifts and in his\r\nexperience. Holmes was not prone to friendship, but he was tolerant of\r\nthe big Scotchman, and smiled at the sight of him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are an early bird, Mr. Mac,\u201d said he. \u201cI wish you luck with your\r\nworm. I fear this means that there is some mischief afoot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you said \u2018hope\u2019 instead of \u2018fear,\u2019 it would be nearer the truth,\r\nI\u2019m thinking, Mr. Holmes,\u201d the inspector answered, with a knowing grin.\r\n\u201cWell, maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill. No, I\r\nwon\u2019t smoke, I thank you. I\u2019ll have to be pushing on my way; for the\r\nearly hours of a case are the precious ones, as no man knows better\r\nthan your own self. But\u2014but\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe inspector had stopped suddenly, and was staring with a look of\r\nabsolute amazement at a paper upon the table. It was the sheet upon\r\nwhich I had scrawled the enigmatic message.\r\n\r\n\u201cDouglas!\u201d he stammered. \u201cBirlstone! What\u2019s this, Mr. Holmes? Man, it\u2019s\r\nwitchcraft! Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you get\r\nthose names?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \u201cWhat\u2019s this, Mr. Holmes? Man, it\u2019s witchcraft! Where\r\nin the name of all that is wonderful did you get those names?\u201d]\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a cipher that Dr. Watson and I have had occasion to solve. But\r\nwhy\u2014what\u2019s amiss with the names?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe inspector looked from one to the other of us in dazed astonishment.\r\n\u201cJust this,\u201d said he, \u201cthat Mr. Douglas of Birlstone Manor House was\r\nhorribly murdered last night!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\nSherlock Holmes Discourses\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one of those dramatic moments for which my friend existed. It\r\nwould be an overstatement to say that he was shocked or even excited by\r\nthe amazing announcement. Without having a tinge of cruelty in his\r\nsingular composition, he was undoubtedly callous from long\r\noverstimulation. Yet, if his emotions were dulled, his intellectual\r\nperceptions were exceedingly active. There was no trace then of the\r\nhorror which I had myself felt at this curt declaration; but his face\r\nshowed rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who\r\nsees the crystals falling into position from his oversaturated\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n\u201cRemarkable!\u201d said he. \u201cRemarkable!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem surprised.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cInterested, Mr. Mac, but hardly surprised. Why should I be surprised?\r\nI receive an anonymous communication from a quarter which I know to be\r\nimportant, warning me that danger threatens a certain person. Within an\r\nhour I learn that this danger has actually materialized and that the\r\nperson is dead. I am interested; but, as you observe, I am not\r\nsurprised.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn a few short sentences he explained to the inspector the facts about\r\nthe letter and the cipher. MacDonald sat with his chin on his hands and\r\nhis great sandy eyebrows bunched into a yellow tangle.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was going down to Birlstone this morning,\u201d said he. \u201cI had come to\r\nask you if you cared to come with me\u2014you and your friend here. But from\r\nwhat you say we might perhaps be doing better work in London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI rather think not,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHang it all, Mr. Holmes!\u201d cried the inspector. \u201cThe papers will be\r\nfull of the Birlstone mystery in a day or two; but where\u2019s the mystery\r\nif there is a man in London who prophesied the crime before ever it\r\noccurred? We have only to lay our hands on that man, and the rest will\r\nfollow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt, Mr. Mac. But how do you propose to lay your hands on the\r\nso-called Porlock?\u201d\r\n\r\nMacDonald turned over the letter which Holmes had handed him. \u201cPosted\r\nin Camberwell\u2014that doesn\u2019t help us much. Name, you say, is assumed. Not\r\nmuch to go on, certainly. Didn\u2019t you say that you have sent him money?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTwice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn notes to Camberwell post office.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you ever trouble to see who called for them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe inspector looked surprised and a little shocked. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause I always keep faith. I had promised when he first wrote that I\r\nwould not try to trace him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think there is someone behind him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know there is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis professor that I\u2019ve heard you mention?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly!\u201d\r\n\r\nInspector MacDonald smiled, and his eyelid quivered as he glanced\r\ntowards me. \u201cI won\u2019t conceal from you, Mr. Holmes, that we think in the\r\nC.I.D. that you have a wee bit of a bee in your bonnet over this\r\nprofessor. I made some inquiries myself about the matter. He seems to\r\nbe a very respectable, learned, and talented sort of man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve got so far as to recognize the talent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMan, you can\u2019t but recognize it! After I heard your view I made it my\r\nbusiness to see him. I had a chat with him on eclipses. How the talk\r\ngot that way I canna think; but he had out a reflector lantern and a\r\nglobe, and made it all clear in a minute. He lent me a book; but I\r\ndon\u2019t mind saying that it was a bit above my head, though I had a good\r\nAberdeen upbringing. He\u2019d have made a grand meenister with his thin\r\nface and gray hair and solemn-like way of talking. When he put his hand\r\non my shoulder as we were parting, it was like a father\u2019s blessing\r\nbefore you go out into the cold, cruel world.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. \u201cGreat!\u201d he said. \u201cGreat! Tell\r\nme, Friend MacDonald, this pleasing and touching interview was, I\r\nsuppose, in the professor\u2019s study?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA fine room, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery fine\u2014very handsome indeed, Mr. Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou sat in front of his writing desk?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it was evening; but I mind that the lamp was turned on my face.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would be. Did you happen to observe a picture over the professor\u2019s\r\nhead?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t miss much, Mr. Holmes. Maybe I learned that from you. Yes, I\r\nsaw the picture\u2014a young woman with her head on her hands, peeping at\r\nyou sideways.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe inspector endeavoured to look interested.\r\n\r\n\u201cJean Baptiste Greuze,\u201d Holmes continued, joining his finger tips and\r\nleaning well back in his chair, \u201cwas a French artist who flourished\r\nbetween the years 1750 and 1800. I allude, of course to his working\r\ncareer. Modern criticism has more than indorsed the high opinion formed\r\nof him by his contemporaries.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe inspector\u2019s eyes grew abstracted. \u201cHadn\u2019t we better\u2014\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are doing so,\u201d Holmes interrupted. \u201cAll that I am saying has a very\r\ndirect and vital bearing upon what you have called the Birlstone\r\nMystery. In fact, it may in a sense be called the very centre of it.\u201d\r\n\r\nMacDonald smiled feebly, and looked appealingly to me. \u201cYour thoughts\r\nmove a bit too quick for me, Mr. Holmes. You leave out a link or two,\r\nand I can\u2019t get over the gap. What in the whole wide world can be the\r\nconnection between this dead painting man and the affair at Birlstone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll knowledge comes useful to the detective,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cEven\r\nthe trivial fact that in the year 1865 a picture by Greuze entitled \u2018La\r\nJeune Fille \u00e0 l\u2019Agneau\u2019 fetched one million two hundred thousand\r\nfrancs\u2014more than forty thousand pounds\u2014at the Portalis sale may start a\r\ntrain of reflection in your mind.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was clear that it did. The inspector looked honestly interested.\r\n\r\n\u201cI may remind you,\u201d Holmes continued, \u201cthat the professor\u2019s salary can\r\nbe ascertained in several trustworthy books of reference. It is seven\r\nhundred a year.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen how could he buy\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so! How could he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, that\u2019s remarkable,\u201d said the inspector thoughtfully. \u201cTalk away,\r\nMr. Holmes. I\u2019m just loving it. It\u2019s fine!\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes smiled. He was always warmed by genuine admiration\u2014the\r\ncharacteristic of the real artist. \u201cWhat about Birlstone?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve time yet,\u201d said the inspector, glancing at his watch. \u201cI\u2019ve a\r\ncab at the door, and it won\u2019t take us twenty minutes to Victoria. But\r\nabout this picture: I thought you told me once, Mr. Holmes, that you\r\nhad never met Professor Moriarty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I never have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen how do you know about his rooms?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s another matter. I have been three times in his rooms, twice\r\nwaiting for him under different pretexts and leaving before he came.\r\nOnce\u2014well, I can hardly tell about the once to an official detective.\r\nIt was on the last occasion that I took the liberty of running over his\r\npapers\u2014with the most unexpected results.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou found something compromising?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely nothing. That was what amazed me. However, you have now\r\nseen the point of the picture. It shows him to be a very wealthy man.\r\nHow did he acquire wealth? He is unmarried. His younger brother is a\r\nstation master in the west of England. His chair is worth seven hundred\r\na year. And he owns a Greuze.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely the inference is plain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean that he has a great income and that he must earn it in an\r\nillegal fashion?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. Of course I have other reasons for thinking so\u2014dozens of\r\nexiguous threads which lead vaguely up towards the centre of the web\r\nwhere the poisonous, motionless creature is lurking. I only mention the\r\nGreuze because it brings the matter within the range of your own\r\nobservation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, I admit that what you say is interesting: it\u2019s more\r\nthan interesting\u2014it\u2019s just wonderful. But let us have it a little\r\nclearer if you can. Is it forgery, coining, burglary\u2014where does the\r\nmoney come from?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you ever read of Jonathan Wild?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, the name has a familiar sound. Someone in a novel, was he not? I\r\ndon\u2019t take much stock of detectives in novels\u2014chaps that do things and\r\nnever let you see how they do them. That\u2019s just inspiration: not\r\nbusiness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJonathan Wild wasn\u2019t a detective, and he wasn\u2019t in a novel. He was a\r\nmaster criminal, and he lived last century\u20141750 or thereabouts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen he\u2019s no use to me. I\u2019m a practical man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Mac, the most practical thing that you ever did in your life would\r\nbe to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve hours a day at\r\nthe annals of crime. Everything comes in circles\u2014even Professor\r\nMoriarty. Jonathan Wild was the hidden force of the London criminals,\r\nto whom he sold his brains and his organization on a fifteen per cent.\r\ncommission. The old wheel turns, and the same spoke comes up. It\u2019s all\r\nbeen done before, and will be again. I\u2019ll tell you one or two things\r\nabout Moriarty which may interest you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll interest me, right enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI happen to know who is the first link in his chain\u2014a chain with this\r\nNapoleon-gone-wrong at one end, and a hundred broken fighting men,\r\npickpockets, blackmailers, and card sharpers at the other, with every\r\nsort of crime in between. His chief of staff is Colonel Sebastian\r\nMoran, as aloof and guarded and inaccessible to the law as himself.\r\nWhat do you think he pays him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to hear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSix thousand a year. That\u2019s paying for brains, you see\u2014the American\r\nbusiness principle. I learned that detail quite by chance. It\u2019s more\r\nthan the Prime Minister gets. That gives you an idea of Moriarty\u2019s\r\ngains and of the scale on which he works. Another point: I made it my\r\nbusiness to hunt down some of Moriarty\u2019s checks lately\u2014just common\r\ninnocent checks that he pays his household bills with. They were drawn\r\non six different banks. Does that make any impression on your mind?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQueer, certainly! But what do you gather from it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat he wanted no gossip about his wealth. No single man should know\r\nwhat he had. I have no doubt that he has twenty banking accounts; the\r\nbulk of his fortune abroad in the Deutsche Bank or the Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais\r\nas likely as not. Sometime when you have a year or two to spare I\r\ncommend to you the study of Professor Moriarty.\u201d\r\n\r\nInspector MacDonald had grown steadily more impressed as the\r\nconversation proceeded. He had lost himself in his interest. Now his\r\npractical Scotch intelligence brought him back with a snap to the\r\nmatter in hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe can keep, anyhow,\u201d said he. \u201cYou\u2019ve got us side-tracked with your\r\ninteresting anecdotes, Mr. Holmes. What really counts is your remark\r\nthat there is some connection between the professor and the crime. That\r\nyou get from the warning received through the man Porlock. Can we for\r\nour present practical needs get any further than that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe may form some conception as to the motives of the crime. It is, as\r\nI gather from your original remarks, an inexplicable, or at least an\r\nunexplained, murder. Now, presuming that the source of the crime is as\r\nwe suspect it to be, there might be two different motives. In the first\r\nplace, I may tell you that Moriarty rules with a rod of iron over his\r\npeople. His discipline is tremendous. There is only one punishment in\r\nhis code. It is death. Now we might suppose that this murdered man\u2014this\r\nDouglas whose approaching fate was known by one of the arch-criminal\u2019s\r\nsubordinates\u2014had in some way betrayed the chief. His punishment\r\nfollowed, and would be known to all\u2014if only to put the fear of death\r\ninto them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that is one suggestion, Mr. Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe other is that it has been engineered by Moriarty in the ordinary\r\ncourse of business. Was there any robbery?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have not heard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf so, it would, of course, be against the first hypothesis and in\r\nfavour of the second. Moriarty may have been engaged to engineer it on\r\na promise of part spoils, or he may have been paid so much down to\r\nmanage it. Either is possible. But whichever it may be, or if it is\r\nsome third combination, it is down at Birlstone that we must seek the\r\nsolution. I know our man too well to suppose that he has left anything\r\nup here which may lead us to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen to Birlstone we must go!\u201d cried MacDonald, jumping from his\r\nchair. \u201cMy word! it\u2019s later than I thought. I can give you, gentlemen,\r\nfive minutes for preparation, and that is all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd ample for us both,\u201d said Holmes, as he sprang up and hastened to\r\nchange from his dressing gown to his coat. \u201cWhile we are on our way,\r\nMr. Mac, I will ask you to be good enough to tell me all about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll about it\u201d proved to be disappointingly little, and yet there was\r\nenough to assure us that the case before us might well be worthy of the\r\nexpert\u2019s closest attention. He brightened and rubbed his thin hands\r\ntogether as he listened to the meagre but remarkable details. A long\r\nseries of sterile weeks lay behind us, and here at last there was a\r\nfitting object for those remarkable powers which, like all special\r\ngifts, become irksome to their owner when they are not in use. That\r\nrazor brain blunted and rusted with inaction.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes\u2019s eyes glistened, his pale cheeks took a warmer hue,\r\nand his whole eager face shone with an inward light when the call for\r\nwork reached him. Leaning forward in the cab, he listened intently to\r\nMacDonald\u2019s short sketch of the problem which awaited us in Sussex. The\r\ninspector was himself dependent, as he explained to us, upon a\r\nscribbled account forwarded to him by the milk train in the early hours\r\nof the morning. White Mason, the local officer, was a personal friend,\r\nand hence MacDonald had been notified much more promptly than is usual\r\nat Scotland Yard when provincials need their assistance. It is a very\r\ncold scent upon which the Metropolitan expert is generally asked to\r\nrun.\r\n\r\n\u201cDEAR INSPECTOR MACDONALD,\u201d said the letter which he read to\r\nus,\u2014\u201cOfficial requisition for your services is in separate envelope.\r\nThis is for your private eye. Wire me what train in the morning you can\r\nget for Birlstone, and I will meet it\u2014or have it met if I am too\r\noccupied. This case is a snorter. Don\u2019t waste a moment in getting\r\nstarted. If you can bring Mr. Holmes, please do so; for he will find\r\nsomething after his own heart. We would think the whole had been fixed\r\nup for theatrical effect if there wasn\u2019t a dead man in the middle of\r\nit. My word! it _is_ a snorter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYour friend seems to be no fool,\u201d remarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, White Mason is a very live man, if I am any judge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, have you anything more?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly that he will give us every detail when we meet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen how did you get at Mr. Douglas and the fact that he had been\r\nhorribly murdered?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was in the inclosed official report. It didn\u2019t say \u2018horrible\u2019:\r\nthat\u2019s not a recognized official term. It gave the name John Douglas.\r\nIt mentioned that his injuries had been in the head, from the discharge\r\nof a shotgun. It also mentioned the hour of the alarm, which was close\r\non to midnight last night. It added that the case was undoubtedly one\r\nof murder, but that no arrest had been made, and that the case was one\r\nwhich presented some very perplexing and extraordinary features. That\u2019s\r\nabsolutely all we have at present, Mr. Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, with your permission, we will leave it at that, Mr. Mac. The\r\ntemptation to form premature theories upon insufficient data is the\r\nbane of our profession. I can see only two things for certain at\r\npresent\u2014a great brain in London, and a dead man in Sussex. It\u2019s the\r\nchain between that we are going to trace.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\nThe Tragedy of Birlstone\r\n\r\n\r\nNow for a moment I will ask leave to remove my own insignificant\r\npersonality and to describe events which occurred before we arrived\r\nupon the scene by the light of knowledge which came to us afterwards.\r\nOnly in this way can I make the reader appreciate the people concerned\r\nand the strange setting in which their fate was cast.\r\n\r\nThe village of Birlstone is a small and very ancient cluster of\r\nhalf-timbered cottages on the northern border of the county of Sussex.\r\nFor centuries it had remained unchanged; but within the last few years\r\nits picturesque appearance and situation have attracted a number of\r\nwell-to-do residents, whose villas peep out from the woods around.\r\nThese woods are locally supposed to be the extreme fringe of the great\r\nWeald forest, which thins away until it reaches the northern chalk\r\ndowns. A number of small shops have come into being to meet the wants\r\nof the increased population; so there seems some prospect that\r\nBirlstone may soon grow from an ancient village into a modern town. It\r\nis the centre for a considerable area of country, since Tunbridge\r\nWells, the nearest place of importance, is ten or twelve miles to the\r\neastward, over the borders of Kent.\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile from the town, standing in an old park famous for its\r\nhuge beech trees, is the ancient Manor House of Birlstone. Part of this\r\nvenerable building dates back to the time of the first crusade, when\r\nHugo de Capus built a fortalice in the centre of the estate, which had\r\nbeen granted to him by the Red King. This was destroyed by fire in\r\n1543, and some of its smoke-blackened corner stones were used when, in\r\nJacobean times, a brick country house rose upon the ruins of the feudal\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\nThe Manor House, with its many gables and its small diamond-paned\r\nwindows, was still much as the builder had left it in the early\r\nseventeenth century. Of the double moats which had guarded its more\r\nwarlike predecessor, the outer had been allowed to dry up, and served\r\nthe humble function of a kitchen garden. The inner one was still there,\r\nand lay forty feet in breadth, though now only a few feet in depth,\r\nround the whole house. A small stream fed it and continued beyond it,\r\nso that the sheet of water, though turbid, was never ditchlike or\r\nunhealthy. The ground floor windows were within a foot of the surface\r\nof the water.\r\n\r\nThe only approach to the house was over a drawbridge, the chains and\r\nwindlass of which had long been rusted and broken. The latest tenants\r\nof the Manor House had, however, with characteristic energy, set this\r\nright, and the drawbridge was not only capable of being raised, but\r\nactually was raised every evening and lowered every morning. By thus\r\nrenewing the custom of the old feudal days the Manor House was\r\nconverted into an island during the night\u2014a fact which had a very\r\ndirect bearing upon the mystery which was soon to engage the attention\r\nof all England.\r\n\r\nThe house had been untenanted for some years and was threatening to\r\nmoulder into a picturesque decay when the Douglases took possession of\r\nit. This family consisted of only two individuals\u2014John Douglas and his\r\nwife. Douglas was a remarkable man, both in character and in person. In\r\nage he may have been about fifty, with a strong-jawed, rugged face, a\r\ngrizzling moustache, peculiarly keen gray eyes, and a wiry, vigorous\r\nfigure which had lost nothing of the strength and activity of youth. He\r\nwas cheery and genial to all, but somewhat offhand in his manners,\r\ngiving the impression that he had seen life in social strata on some\r\nfar lower horizon than the county society of Sussex.\r\n\r\nYet, though looked at with some curiosity and reserve by his more\r\ncultivated neighbours, he soon acquired a great popularity among the\r\nvillagers, subscribing handsomely to all local objects, and attending\r\ntheir smoking concerts and other functions, where, having a remarkably\r\nrich tenor voice, he was always ready to oblige with an excellent song.\r\nHe appeared to have plenty of money, which was said to have been gained\r\nin the California gold fields, and it was clear from his own talk and\r\nthat of his wife that he had spent a part of his life in America.\r\n\r\nThe good impression which had been produced by his generosity and by\r\nhis democratic manners was increased by a reputation gained for utter\r\nindifference to danger. Though a wretched rider, he turned out at every\r\nmeet, and took the most amazing falls in his determination to hold his\r\nown with the best. When the vicarage caught fire he distinguished\r\nhimself also by the fearlessness with which he reentered the building\r\nto save property, after the local fire brigade had given it up as\r\nimpossible. Thus it came about that John Douglas of the Manor House had\r\nwithin five years won himself quite a reputation in Birlstone.\r\n\r\nHis wife, too, was popular with those who had made her acquaintance;\r\nthough, after the English fashion, the callers upon a stranger who\r\nsettled in the county without introductions were few and far between.\r\nThis mattered the less to her, as she was retiring by disposition, and\r\nvery much absorbed, to all appearance, in her husband and her domestic\r\nduties. It was known that she was an English lady who had met Mr.\r\nDouglas in London, he being at that time a widower. She was a beautiful\r\nwoman, tall, dark, and slender, some twenty years younger than her\r\nhusband; a disparity which seemed in no wise to mar the contentment of\r\ntheir family life.\r\n\r\nIt was remarked sometimes, however, by those who knew them best, that\r\nthe confidence between the two did not appear to be complete, since the\r\nwife was either very reticent about her husband\u2019s past life, or else,\r\nas seemed more likely, was imperfectly informed about it. It had also\r\nbeen noted and commented upon by a few observant people that there were\r\nsigns sometimes of some nerve-strain upon the part of Mrs. Douglas, and\r\nthat she would display acute uneasiness if her absent husband should\r\never be particularly late in his return. On a quiet countryside, where\r\nall gossip is welcome, this weakness of the lady of the Manor House did\r\nnot pass without remark, and it bulked larger upon people\u2019s memory when\r\nthe events arose which gave it a very special significance.\r\n\r\nThere was yet another individual whose residence under that roof was,\r\nit is true, only an intermittent one, but whose presence at the time of\r\nthe strange happenings which will now be narrated brought his name\r\nprominently before the public. This was Cecil James Barker, of Hales\r\nLodge, Hampstead.\r\n\r\nCecil Barker\u2019s tall, loose-jointed figure was a familiar one in the\r\nmain street of Birlstone village; for he was a frequent and welcome\r\nvisitor at the Manor House. He was the more noticed as being the only\r\nfriend of the past unknown life of Mr. Douglas who was ever seen in his\r\nnew English surroundings. Barker was himself an undoubted Englishman;\r\nbut by his remarks it was clear that he had first known Douglas in\r\nAmerica and had there lived on intimate terms with him. He appeared to\r\nbe a man of considerable wealth, and was reputed to be a bachelor.\r\n\r\nIn age he was rather younger than Douglas\u2014forty-five at the most\u2014a\r\ntall, straight, broad-chested fellow with a clean-shaved, prize-fighter\r\nface, thick, strong, black eyebrows, and a pair of masterful black eyes\r\nwhich might, even without the aid of his very capable hands, clear a\r\nway for him through a hostile crowd. He neither rode nor shot, but\r\nspent his days in wandering round the old village with his pipe in his\r\nmouth, or in driving with his host, or in his absence with his hostess,\r\nover the beautiful countryside. \u201cAn easy-going, free-handed gentleman,\u201d\r\nsaid Ames, the butler. \u201cBut, my word! I had rather not be the man that\r\ncrossed him!\u201d He was cordial and intimate with Douglas, and he was no\r\nless friendly with his wife\u2014a friendship which more than once seemed to\r\ncause some irritation to the husband, so that even the servants were\r\nable to perceive his annoyance. Such was the third person who was one\r\nof the family when the catastrophe occurred.\r\n\r\nAs to the other denizens of the old building, it will suffice out of a\r\nlarge household to mention the prim, respectable, and capable Ames, and\r\nMrs. Allen, a buxom and cheerful person, who relieved the lady of some\r\nof her household cares. The other six servants in the house bear no\r\nrelation to the events of the night of January 6th.\r\n\r\nIt was at eleven forty-five that the first alarm reached the small\r\nlocal police station, in charge of Sergeant Wilson of the Sussex\r\nConstabulary. Cecil Barker, much excited, had rushed up to the door and\r\npealed furiously upon the bell. A terrible tragedy had occurred at the\r\nManor House, and John Douglas had been murdered. That was the\r\nbreathless burden of his message. He had hurried back to the house,\r\nfollowed within a few minutes by the police sergeant, who arrived at\r\nthe scene of the crime a little after twelve o\u2019clock, after taking\r\nprompt steps to warn the county authorities that something serious was\r\nafoot.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Manor House, the sergeant had found the drawbridge\r\ndown, the windows lighted up, and the whole household in a state of\r\nwild confusion and alarm. The white-faced servants were huddling\r\ntogether in the hall, with the frightened butler wringing his hands in\r\nthe doorway. Only Cecil Barker seemed to be master of himself and his\r\nemotions; he had opened the door which was nearest to the entrance and\r\nhe had beckoned to the sergeant to follow him. At that moment there\r\narrived Dr. Wood, a brisk and capable general practitioner from the\r\nvillage. The three men entered the fatal room together, while the\r\nhorror-stricken butler followed at their heels, closing the door behind\r\nhim to shut out the terrible scene from the maid servants.\r\n\r\nThe dead man lay on his back, sprawling with outstretched limbs in the\r\ncentre of the room. He was clad only in a pink dressing gown, which\r\ncovered his night clothes. There were carpet slippers on his bare feet.\r\nThe doctor knelt beside him and held down the hand lamp which had stood\r\non the table. One glance at the victim was enough to show the healer\r\nthat his presence could be dispensed with. The man had been horribly\r\ninjured. Lying across his chest was a curious weapon, a shotgun with\r\nthe barrel sawed off a foot in front of the triggers. It was clear that\r\nthis had been fired at close range and that he had received the whole\r\ncharge in the face, blowing his head almost to pieces. The triggers had\r\nbeen wired together, so as to make the simultaneous discharge more\r\ndestructive.\r\n\r\nThe country policeman was unnerved and troubled by the tremendous\r\nresponsibility which had come so suddenly upon him. \u201cWe will touch\r\nnothing until my superiors arrive,\u201d he said in a hushed voice, staring\r\nin horror at the dreadful head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing has been touched up to now,\u201d said Cecil Barker. \u201cI\u2019ll answer\r\nfor that. You see it all exactly as I found it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen was that?\u201d The sergeant had drawn out his notebook.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was just half-past eleven. I had not begun to undress, and I was\r\nsitting by the fire in my bedroom when I heard the report. It was not\r\nvery loud\u2014it seemed to be muffled. I rushed down\u2014I don\u2019t suppose it was\r\nthirty seconds before I was in the room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas the door open?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it was open. Poor Douglas was lying as you see him. His bedroom\r\ncandle was burning on the table. It was I who lit the lamp some minutes\r\nafterward.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you see no one?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. I heard Mrs. Douglas coming down the stair behind me, and I rushed\r\nout to prevent her from seeing this dreadful sight. Mrs. Allen, the\r\nhousekeeper, came and took her away. Ames had arrived, and we ran back\r\ninto the room once more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut surely I have heard that the drawbridge is kept up all night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it was up until I lowered it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen how could any murderer have got away? It is out of the question!\r\nMr. Douglas must have shot himself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was our first idea. But see!\u201d Barker drew aside the curtain, and\r\nshowed that the long, diamond-paned window was open to its full extent.\r\n\u201cAnd look at this!\u201d He held the lamp down and illuminated a smudge of\r\nblood like the mark of a boot-sole upon the wooden sill. \u201cSomeone has\r\nstood there in getting out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean that someone waded across the moat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen if you were in the room within half a minute of the crime, he\r\nmust have been in the water at that very moment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have not a doubt of it. I wish to heaven that I had rushed to the\r\nwindow! But the curtain screened it, as you can see, and so it never\r\noccurred to me. Then I heard the step of Mrs. Douglas, and I could not\r\nlet her enter the room. It would have been too horrible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHorrible enough!\u201d said the doctor, looking at the shattered head and\r\nthe terrible marks which surrounded it. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such injuries\r\nsince the Birlstone railway smash.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, I say,\u201d remarked the police sergeant, whose slow, bucolic common\r\nsense was still pondering the open window. \u201cIt\u2019s all very well your\r\nsaying that a man escaped by wading this moat, but what I ask you is,\r\nhow did he ever get into the house at all if the bridge was up?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s the question,\u201d said Barker.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt what o\u2019clock was it raised?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was nearly six o\u2019clock,\u201d said Ames, the butler.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard,\u201d said the sergeant, \u201cthat it was usually raised at sunset.\r\nThat would be nearer half-past four than six at this time of year.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Douglas had visitors to tea,\u201d said Ames. \u201cI couldn\u2019t raise it\r\nuntil they went. Then I wound it up myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen it comes to this,\u201d said the sergeant: \u201cIf anyone came from\r\noutside\u2014_if_ they did\u2014they must have got in across the bridge before\r\nsix and been in hiding ever since, until Mr. Douglas came into the room\r\nafter eleven.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is so! Mr. Douglas went round the house every night the last\r\nthing before he turned in to see that the lights were right. That\r\nbrought him in here. The man was waiting and shot him. Then he got away\r\nthrough the window and left his gun behind him. That\u2019s how I read it;\r\nfor nothing else will fit the facts.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe sergeant picked up a card which lay beside the dead man on the\r\nfloor. The initials V.V. and under them the number 341 were rudely\r\nscrawled in ink upon it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, holding it up.\r\n\r\nBarker looked at it with curiosity. \u201cI never noticed it before,\u201d he\r\nsaid. \u201cThe murderer must have left it behind him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cV.V.\u2014341. I can make no sense of that.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe sergeant kept turning it over in his big fingers. \u201cWhat\u2019s V.V.?\r\nSomebody\u2019s initials, maybe. What have you got there, Dr. Wood?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a good-sized hammer which had been lying on the rug in front of\r\nthe fireplace\u2014a substantial, workmanlike hammer. Cecil Barker pointed\r\nto a box of brass-headed nails upon the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Douglas was altering the pictures yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw him\r\nmyself, standing upon that chair and fixing the big picture above it.\r\nThat accounts for the hammer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019d best put it back on the rug where we found it,\u201d said the\r\nsergeant, scratching his puzzled head in his perplexity. \u201cIt will want\r\nthe best brains in the force to get to the bottom of this thing. It\r\nwill be a London job before it is finished.\u201d He raised the hand lamp\r\nand walked slowly round the room. \u201cHullo!\u201d he cried, excitedly, drawing\r\nthe window curtain to one side. \u201cWhat o\u2019clock were those curtains\r\ndrawn?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen the lamps were lit,\u201d said the butler. \u201cIt would be shortly after\r\nfour.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSomeone had been hiding here, sure enough.\u201d He held down the light,\r\nand the marks of muddy boots were very visible in the corner. \u201cI\u2019m\r\nbound to say this bears out your theory, Mr. Barker. It looks as if the\r\nman got into the house after four when the curtains were drawn, and\r\nbefore six when the bridge was raised. He slipped into this room,\r\nbecause it was the first that he saw. There was no other place where he\r\ncould hide, so he popped in behind this curtain. That all seems clear\r\nenough. It is likely that his main idea was to burgle the house; but\r\nMr. Douglas chanced to come upon him, so he murdered him and escaped.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I read it,\u201d said Barker. \u201cBut, I say, aren\u2019t we wasting\r\nprecious time? Couldn\u2019t we start out and scout the country before the\r\nfellow gets away?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe sergeant considered for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are no trains before six in the morning; so he can\u2019t get away by\r\nrail. If he goes by road with his legs all dripping, it\u2019s odds that\r\nsomeone will notice him. Anyhow, I can\u2019t leave here myself until I am\r\nrelieved. But I think none of you should go until we see more clearly\r\nhow we all stand.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor had taken the lamp and was narrowly scrutinizing the body.\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this mark?\u201d he asked. \u201cCould this have any connection with the\r\ncrime?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dead man\u2019s right arm was thrust out from his dressing gown, and\r\nexposed as high as the elbow. About halfway up the forearm was a\r\ncurious brown design, a triangle inside a circle, standing out in vivid\r\nrelief upon the lard-coloured skin.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not tattooed,\u201d said the doctor, peering through his glasses. \u201cI\r\nnever saw anything like it. The man has been branded at some time as\r\nthey brand cattle. What is the meaning of this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t profess to know the meaning of it,\u201d said Cecil Barker; \u201cbut I\r\nhave seen the mark on Douglas many times this last ten years.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so have I,\u201d said the butler. \u201cMany a time when the master has\r\nrolled up his sleeves I have noticed that very mark. I\u2019ve often\r\nwondered what it could be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen it has nothing to do with the crime, anyhow,\u201d said the sergeant.\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a rum thing all the same. Everything about this case is rum.\r\nWell, what is it now?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe butler had given an exclamation of astonishment and was pointing at\r\nthe dead man\u2019s outstretched hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ve taken his wedding ring!\u201d he gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, indeed. Master always wore his plain gold wedding ring on the\r\nlittle finger of his left hand. That ring with the rough nugget on it\r\nwas above it, and the twisted snake ring on the third finger. There\u2019s\r\nthe nugget and there\u2019s the snake, but the wedding ring is gone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d said Barker.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you tell me,\u201d said the sergeant, \u201cthat the wedding ring was _below_\r\nthe other?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlways!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen the murderer, or whoever it was, first took off this ring you\r\ncall the nugget ring, then the wedding ring, and afterwards put the\r\nnugget ring back again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is so!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe worthy country policeman shook his head. \u201cSeems to me the sooner we\r\nget London on to this case the better,\u201d said he. \u201cWhite Mason is a\r\nsmart man. No local job has ever been too much for White Mason. It\r\nwon\u2019t be long now before he is here to help us. But I expect we\u2019ll have\r\nto look to London before we are through. Anyhow, I\u2019m not ashamed to say\r\nthat it is a deal too thick for the likes of me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\nDarkness\r\n\r\n\r\nAt three in the morning the chief Sussex detective, obeying the urgent\r\ncall from Sergeant Wilson of Birlstone, arrived from headquarters in a\r\nlight dog-cart behind a breathless trotter. By the five-forty train in\r\nthe morning he had sent his message to Scotland Yard, and he was at the\r\nBirlstone station at twelve o\u2019clock to welcome us. White Mason was a\r\nquiet, comfortable-looking person in a loose tweed suit, with a\r\nclean-shaved, ruddy face, a stoutish body, and powerful bandy legs\r\nadorned with gaiters, looking like a small farmer, a retired\r\ngamekeeper, or anything upon earth except a very favourable specimen of\r\nthe provincial criminal officer.\r\n\r\n\u201cA real downright snorter, Mr. MacDonald!\u201d he kept repeating. \u201cWe\u2019ll\r\nhave the pressmen down like flies when they understand it. I\u2019m hoping\r\nwe will get our work done before they get poking their noses into it\r\nand messing up all the trails. There has been nothing like this that I\r\ncan remember. There are some bits that will come home to you, Mr.\r\nHolmes, or I am mistaken. And you also, Dr. Watson; for the medicos\r\nwill have a word to say before we finish. Your room is at the Westville\r\nArms. There\u2019s no other place; but I hear that it is clean and good. The\r\nman will carry your bags. This way, gentlemen, if you please.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was a very bustling and genial person, this Sussex detective. In ten\r\nminutes we had all found our quarters. In ten more we were seated in\r\nthe parlour of the inn and being treated to a rapid sketch of those\r\nevents which have been outlined in the previous chapter. MacDonald made\r\nan occasional note; while Holmes sat absorbed, with the expression of\r\nsurprised and reverent admiration with which the botanist surveys the\r\nrare and precious bloom.\r\n\r\n\u201cRemarkable!\u201d he said, when the story was unfolded, \u201cmost remarkable! I\r\ncan hardly recall any case where the features have been more peculiar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you would say so, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said White Mason in great\r\ndelight. \u201cWe\u2019re well up with the times in Sussex. I\u2019ve told you now how\r\nmatters were, up to the time when I took over from Sergeant Wilson\r\nbetween three and four this morning. My word! I made the old mare go!\r\nBut I need not have been in such a hurry, as it turned out; for there\r\nwas nothing immediate that I could do. Sergeant Wilson had all the\r\nfacts. I checked them and considered them and maybe added a few of my\r\nown.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat were they?\u201d asked Holmes eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I first had the hammer examined. There was Dr. Wood there to\r\nhelp me. We found no signs of violence upon it. I was hoping that if\r\nMr. Douglas defended himself with the hammer, he might have left his\r\nmark upon the murderer before he dropped it on the mat. But there was\r\nno stain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat, of course, proves nothing at all,\u201d remarked Inspector MacDonald.\r\n\u201cThere has been many a hammer murder and no trace on the hammer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. It doesn\u2019t prove it wasn\u2019t used. But there might have been\r\nstains, and that would have helped us. As a matter of fact there were\r\nnone. Then I examined the gun. They were buckshot cartridges, and, as\r\nSergeant Wilson pointed out, the triggers were wired together so that,\r\nif you pulled on the hinder one, both barrels were discharged. Whoever\r\nfixed that up had made up his mind that he was going to take no chances\r\nof missing his man. The sawed gun was not more than two foot long\u2014one\r\ncould carry it easily under one\u2019s coat. There was no complete maker\u2019s\r\nname; but the printed letters P-E-N were on the fluting between the\r\nbarrels, and the rest of the name had been cut off by the saw.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA big P with a flourish above it, E and N smaller?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPennsylvania Small Arms Company\u2014well-known American firm,\u201d said\r\nHolmes.\r\n\r\nWhite Mason gazed at my friend as the little village practitioner looks\r\nat the Harley Street specialist who by a word can solve the\r\ndifficulties that perplex him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is very helpful, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right. Wonderful!\r\nWonderful! Do you carry the names of all the gun makers in the world in\r\nyour memory?\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes dismissed the subject with a wave.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt it is an American shotgun,\u201d White Mason continued. \u201cI seem to\r\nhave read that a sawed-off shotgun is a weapon used in some parts of\r\nAmerica. Apart from the name upon the barrel, the idea had occurred to\r\nme. There is some evidence then, that this man who entered the house\r\nand killed its master was an American.\u201d\r\n\r\nMacDonald shook his head. \u201cMan, you are surely travelling overfast,\u201d\r\nsaid he. \u201cI have heard no evidence yet that any stranger was ever in\r\nthe house at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe open window, the blood on the sill, the queer card, the marks of\r\nboots in the corner, the gun!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing there that could not have been arranged. Mr. Douglas was an\r\nAmerican, or had lived long in America. So had Mr. Barker. You don\u2019t\r\nneed to import an American from outside in order to account for\r\nAmerican doings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAmes, the butler\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about him? Is he reliable?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTen years with Sir Charles Chandos\u2014as solid as a rock. He has been\r\nwith Douglas ever since he took the Manor House five years ago. He has\r\nnever seen a gun of this sort in the house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe gun was made to conceal. That\u2019s why the barrels were sawed. It\r\nwould fit into any box. How could he swear there was no such gun in the\r\nhouse?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, anyhow, he had never seen one.\u201d\r\n\r\nMacDonald shook his obstinate Scotch head. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced yet that\r\nthere was ever anyone in the house,\u201d said he. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to\r\nconseedar\u201d (his accent became more Aberdonian as he lost himself in his\r\nargument) \u201cI\u2019m asking you to conseedar what it involves if you suppose\r\nthat this gun was ever brought into the house, and that all these\r\nstrange things were done by a person from outside. Oh, man, it\u2019s just\r\ninconceivable! It\u2019s clean against common sense! I put it to you, Mr.\r\nHolmes, judging it by what we have heard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, state your case, Mr. Mac,\u201d said Holmes in his most judicial\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man is not a burglar, supposing that he ever existed. The ring\r\nbusiness and the card point to premeditated murder for some private\r\nreason. Very good. Here is a man who slips into a house with the\r\ndeliberate intention of committing murder. He knows, if he knows\r\nanything, that he will have a deeficulty in making his escape, as the\r\nhouse is surrounded with water. What weapon would he choose? You would\r\nsay the most silent in the world. Then he could hope when the deed was\r\ndone to slip quickly from the window, to wade the moat, and to get away\r\nat his leisure. That\u2019s understandable. But is it understandable that he\r\nshould go out of his way to bring with him the most noisy weapon he\r\ncould select, knowing well that it will fetch every human being in the\r\nhouse to the spot as quick as they can run, and that it is all odds\r\nthat he will be seen before he can get across the moat? Is that\r\ncredible, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you put the case strongly,\u201d my friend replied thoughtfully. \u201cIt\r\ncertainly needs a good deal of justification. May I ask, Mr. White\r\nMason, whether you examined the farther side of the moat at once to see\r\nif there were any signs of the man having climbed out from the water?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were no signs, Mr. Holmes. But it is a stone ledge, and one\r\ncould hardly expect them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo tracks or marks?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! Would there be any objection, Mr. White Mason, to our going down\r\nto the house at once? There may possibly be some small point which\r\nmight be suggestive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was going to propose it, Mr. Holmes; but I thought it well to put\r\nyou in touch with all the facts before we go. I suppose if anything\r\nshould strike you\u2014\u201d White Mason looked doubtfully at the amateur.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have worked with Mr. Holmes before,\u201d said Inspector MacDonald. \u201cHe\r\nplays the game.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy own idea of the game, at any rate,\u201d said Holmes, with a smile. \u201cI\r\ngo into a case to help the ends of justice and the work of the police.\r\nIf I have ever separated myself from the official force, it is because\r\nthey have first separated themselves from me. I have no wish ever to\r\nscore at their expense. At the same time, Mr. White Mason, I claim the\r\nright to work in my own way and give my results at my own time\u2014complete\r\nrather than in stages.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure we are honoured by your presence and to show you all we\r\nknow,\u201d said White Mason cordially. \u201cCome along, Dr. Watson, and when\r\nthe time comes we\u2019ll all hope for a place in your book.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe walked down the quaint village street with a row of pollarded elms\r\non each side of it. Just beyond were two ancient stone pillars,\r\nweather-stained and lichen-blotched, bearing upon their summits a\r\nshapeless something which had once been the rampant lion of Capus of\r\nBirlstone. A short walk along the winding drive with such sward and\r\noaks around it as one only sees in rural England, then a sudden turn,\r\nand the long, low Jacobean house of dingy, liver-coloured brick lay\r\nbefore us, with an old-fashioned garden of cut yews on each side of it.\r\nAs we approached it, there was the wooden drawbridge and the beautiful\r\nbroad moat as still and luminous as quicksilver in the cold, winter\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nThree centuries had flowed past the old Manor House, centuries of\r\nbirths and of homecomings, of country dances and of the meetings of fox\r\nhunters. Strange that now in its old age this dark business should have\r\ncast its shadow upon the venerable walls! And yet those strange, peaked\r\nroofs and quaint, overhung gables were a fitting covering to grim and\r\nterrible intrigue. As I looked at the deep-set windows and the long\r\nsweep of the dull-coloured, water-lapped front, I felt that no more\r\nfitting scene could be set for such a tragedy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the window,\u201d said White Mason, \u201cthat one on the immediate right\r\nof the drawbridge. It\u2019s open just as it was found last night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks rather narrow for a man to pass.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t a fat man, anyhow. We don\u2019t need your deductions, Mr.\r\nHolmes, to tell us that. But you or I could squeeze through all right.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes walked to the edge of the moat and looked across. Then he\r\nexamined the stone ledge and the grass border beyond it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a good look, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said White Mason. \u201cThere is nothing\r\nthere, no sign that anyone has landed\u2014but why should he leave any\r\nsign?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. Why should he? Is the water always turbid?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGenerally about this colour. The stream brings down the clay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow deep is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout two feet at each side and three in the middle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo we can put aside all idea of the man having been drowned in\r\ncrossing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, a child could not be drowned in it.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe walked across the drawbridge, and were admitted by a quaint,\r\ngnarled, dried-up person, who was the butler, Ames. The poor old fellow\r\nwas white and quivering from the shock. The village sergeant, a tall,\r\nformal, melancholy man, still held his vigil in the room of Fate. The\r\ndoctor had departed.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnything fresh, Sergeant Wilson?\u201d asked White Mason.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you can go home. You\u2019ve had enough. We can send for you if we\r\nwant you. The butler had better wait outside. Tell him to warn Mr.\r\nCecil Barker, Mrs. Douglas, and the housekeeper that we may want a word\r\nwith them presently. Now, gentlemen, perhaps you will allow me to give\r\nyou the views I have formed first, and then you will be able to arrive\r\nat your own.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe impressed me, this country specialist. He had a solid grip of fact\r\nand a cool, clear, common-sense brain, which should take him some way\r\nin his profession. Holmes listened to him intently, with no sign of\r\nthat impatience which the official exponent too often produced.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it suicide, or is it murder\u2014that\u2019s our first question, gentlemen,\r\nis it not? If it were suicide, then we have to believe that this man\r\nbegan by taking off his wedding ring and concealing it; that he then\r\ncame down here in his dressing gown, trampled mud into a corner behind\r\nthe curtain in order to give the idea someone had waited for him,\r\nopened the window, put blood on the\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe can surely dismiss that,\u201d said MacDonald.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I think. Suicide is out of the question. Then a murder has been\r\ndone. What we have to determine is, whether it was done by someone\r\noutside or inside the house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s hear the argument.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are considerable difficulties both ways, and yet one or the\r\nother it must be. We will suppose first that some person or persons\r\ninside the house did the crime. They got this man down here at a time\r\nwhen everything was still and yet no one was asleep. They then did the\r\ndeed with the queerest and noisiest weapon in the world so as to tell\r\neveryone what had happened\u2014a weapon that was never seen in the house\r\nbefore. That does not seem a very likely start, does it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it does not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, everyone is agreed that after the alarm was given only a\r\nminute at the most had passed before the whole household\u2014not Mr. Cecil\r\nBarker alone, though he claims to have been the first, but Ames and all\r\nof them were on the spot. Do you tell me that in that time the guilty\r\nperson managed to make footmarks in the corner, open the window, mark\r\nthe sill with blood, take the wedding ring off the dead man\u2019s finger,\r\nand all the rest of it? It\u2019s impossible!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou put it very clearly,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI am inclined to agree with\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, we are driven back to the theory that it was done by\r\nsomeone from outside. We are still faced with some big difficulties;\r\nbut anyhow they have ceased to be impossibilities. The man got into the\r\nhouse between four-thirty and six; that is to say, between dusk and the\r\ntime when the bridge was raised. There had been some visitors, and the\r\ndoor was open; so there was nothing to prevent him. He may have been a\r\ncommon burglar, or he may have had some private grudge against Mr.\r\nDouglas. Since Mr. Douglas has spent most of his life in America, and\r\nthis shotgun seems to be an American weapon, it would seem that the\r\nprivate grudge is the more likely theory. He slipped into this room\r\nbecause it was the first he came to, and he hid behind the curtain.\r\nThere he remained until past eleven at night. At that time Mr. Douglas\r\nentered the room. It was a short interview, if there were any interview\r\nat all; for Mrs. Douglas declares that her husband had not left her\r\nmore than a few minutes when she heard the shot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe candle shows that,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. The candle, which was a new one, is not burned more than half\r\nan inch. He must have placed it on the table before he was attacked;\r\notherwise, of course, it would have fallen when he fell. This shows\r\nthat he was not attacked the instant that he entered the room. When Mr.\r\nBarker arrived the candle was lit and the lamp was out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all clear enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, now, we can reconstruct things on those lines. Mr. Douglas\r\nenters the room. He puts down the candle. A man appears from behind the\r\ncurtain. He is armed with this gun. He demands the wedding ring\u2014Heaven\r\nonly knows why, but so it must have been. Mr. Douglas gave it up. Then\r\neither in cold blood or in the course of a struggle\u2014Douglas may have\r\ngripped the hammer that was found upon the mat\u2014he shot Douglas in this\r\nhorrible way. He dropped his gun and also it would seem this queer\r\ncard\u2014V.V. 341, whatever that may mean\u2014and he made his escape through\r\nthe window and across the moat at the very moment when Cecil Barker was\r\ndiscovering the crime. How\u2019s that, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery interesting, but just a little unconvincing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMan, it would be absolute nonsense if it wasn\u2019t that anything else is\r\neven worse!\u201d cried MacDonald. \u201cSomebody killed the man, and whoever it\r\nwas I could clearly prove to you that he should have done it some other\r\nway. What does he mean by allowing his retreat to be cut off like that?\r\nWhat does he mean by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of\r\nescape? Come, Mr. Holmes, it\u2019s up to you to give us a lead, since you\r\nsay Mr. White Mason\u2019s theory is unconvincing.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes had sat intently observant during this long discussion, missing\r\nno word that was said, with his keen eyes darting to right and to left,\r\nand his forehead wrinkled with speculation.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like a few more facts before I get so far as a theory, Mr.\r\nMac,\u201d said he, kneeling down beside the body. \u201cDear me! these injuries\r\nare really appalling. Can we have the butler in for a moment?... Ames,\r\nI understand that you have often seen this very unusual mark\u2014a branded\r\ntriangle inside a circle\u2014upon Mr. Douglas\u2019s forearm?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrequently, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou never heard any speculation as to what it meant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must have caused great pain when it was inflicted. It is\r\nundoubtedly a burn. Now, I observe, Ames, that there is a small piece\r\nof plaster at the angle of Mr. Douglas\u2019s jaw. Did you observe that in\r\nlife?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, he cut himself in shaving yesterday morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you ever know him to cut himself in shaving before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot for a very long time, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuggestive!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt may, of course, be a mere coincidence,\r\nor it may point to some nervousness which would indicate that he had\r\nreason to apprehend danger. Had you noticed anything unusual in his\r\nconduct, yesterday, Ames?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt struck me that he was a little restless and excited, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! The attack may not have been entirely unexpected. We do seem to\r\nmake a little progress, do we not? Perhaps you would rather do the\r\nquestioning, Mr. Mac?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Mr. Holmes, it\u2019s in better hands than mine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, we will pass to this card\u2014V.V. 341. It is rough cardboard.\r\nHave you any of the sort in the house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes walked across to the desk and dabbed a little ink from each\r\nbottle on to the blotting paper. \u201cIt was not printed in this room,\u201d he\r\nsaid; \u201cthis is black ink and the other purplish. It was done by a thick\r\npen, and these are fine. No, it was done elsewhere, I should say. Can\r\nyou make anything of the inscription, Ames?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think, Mr. Mac?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt gives me the impression of a secret society of some sort; the same\r\nwith his badge upon the forearm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my idea, too,\u201d said White Mason.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we can adopt it as a working hypothesis and then see how far our\r\ndifficulties disappear. An agent from such a society makes his way into\r\nthe house, waits for Mr. Douglas, blows his head nearly off with this\r\nweapon, and escapes by wading the moat, after leaving a card beside the\r\ndead man, which will, when mentioned in the papers, tell other members\r\nof the society that vengeance has been done. That all hangs together.\r\nBut why this gun, of all weapons?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why the missing ring?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why no arrest? It\u2019s past two now. I take it for granted that since\r\ndawn every constable within forty miles has been looking out for a wet\r\nstranger?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is so, Mr. Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, unless he has a burrow close by or a change of clothes ready,\r\nthey can hardly miss him. And yet they _have_ missed him up to now!\u201d\r\nHolmes had gone to the window and was examining with his lens the blood\r\nmark on the sill. \u201cIt is clearly the tread of a shoe. It is remarkably\r\nbroad; a splay-foot, one would say. Curious, because, so far as one can\r\ntrace any footmark in this mud-stained corner, one would say it was a\r\nmore shapely sole. However, they are certainly very indistinct. What\u2019s\r\nthis under the side table?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Douglas\u2019s dumb-bells,\u201d said Ames.\r\n\r\n\u201cDumb-bell\u2014there\u2019s only one. Where\u2019s the other?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mr. Holmes. There may have been only one. I have not\r\nnoticed them for months.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne dumb-bell\u2014\u201d Holmes said seriously; but his remarks were\r\ninterrupted by a sharp knock at the door.\r\n\r\nA tall, sunburned, capable-looking, clean-shaved man looked in at us. I\r\nhad no difficulty in guessing that it was the Cecil Barker of whom I\r\nhad heard. His masterful eyes travelled quickly with a questioning\r\nglance from face to face.\r\n\r\n\u201cSorry to interrupt your consultation,\u201d said he, \u201cbut you should hear\r\nthe latest news.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn arrest?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo such luck. But they\u2019ve found his bicycle. The fellow left his\r\nbicycle behind him. Come and have a look. It is within a hundred yards\r\nof the hall door.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe found three or four grooms and idlers standing in the drive\r\ninspecting a bicycle which had been drawn out from a clump of\r\nevergreens in which it had been concealed. It was a well used\r\nRudge-Whitworth, splashed as from a considerable journey. There was a\r\nsaddlebag with spanner and oilcan, but no clue as to the owner.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would be a grand help to the police,\u201d said the inspector, \u201cif these\r\nthings were numbered and registered. But we must be thankful for what\r\nwe\u2019ve got. If we can\u2019t find where he went to, at least we are likely to\r\nget where he came from. But what in the name of all that is wonderful\r\nmade the fellow leave it behind? And how in the world has he got away\r\nwithout it? We don\u2019t seem to get a gleam of light in the case, Mr.\r\nHolmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t we?\u201d my friend answered thoughtfully. \u201cI wonder!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\nThe People of the Drama\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you seen all you want of the study?\u201d asked White Mason as we\r\nreentered the house.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the time,\u201d said the inspector, and Holmes nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen perhaps you would now like to hear the evidence of some of the\r\npeople in the house. We could use the dining room, Ames. Please come\r\nyourself first and tell us what you know.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe butler\u2019s account was a simple and a clear one, and he gave a\r\nconvincing impression of sincerity. He had been engaged five years\r\nbefore, when Douglas first came to Birlstone. He understood that Mr.\r\nDouglas was a rich gentleman who had made his money in America. He had\r\nbeen a kind and considerate employer\u2014not quite what Ames was used to,\r\nperhaps; but one can\u2019t have everything. He never saw any signs of\r\napprehension in Mr. Douglas: on the contrary, he was the most fearless\r\nman he had ever known. He ordered the drawbridge to be pulled up every\r\nnight because it was the ancient custom of the old house, and he liked\r\nto keep the old ways up.\r\n\r\nMr. Douglas seldom went to London or left the village; but on the day\r\nbefore the crime he had been shopping at Tunbridge Wells. He (Ames) had\r\nobserved some restlessness and excitement on the part of Mr. Douglas\r\nthat day; for he had seemed impatient and irritable, which was unusual\r\nwith him. He had not gone to bed that night; but was in the pantry at\r\nthe back of the house, putting away the silver, when he heard the bell\r\nring violently. He heard no shot; but it was hardly possible he would,\r\nas the pantry and kitchens were at the very back of the house and there\r\nwere several closed doors and a long passage between. The housekeeper\r\nhad come out of her room, attracted by the violent ringing of the bell.\r\nThey had gone to the front of the house together.\r\n\r\nAs they reached the bottom of the stairs he had seen Mrs. Douglas\r\ncoming down it. No, she was not hurrying; it did not seem to him that\r\nshe was particularly agitated. Just as she reached the bottom of the\r\nstair Mr. Barker had rushed out of the study. He had stopped Mrs.\r\nDouglas and begged her to go back.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, go back to your room!\u201d he cried. \u201cPoor Jack is dead!\r\nYou can do nothing. For God\u2019s sake, go back!\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter some persuasion upon the stairs Mrs. Douglas had gone back. She\r\ndid not scream. She made no outcry whatever. Mrs. Allen, the\r\nhousekeeper, had taken her upstairs and stayed with her in the bedroom.\r\nAmes and Mr. Barker had then returned to the study, where they had\r\nfound everything exactly as the police had seen it. The candle was not\r\nlit at that time; but the lamp was burning. They had looked out of the\r\nwindow; but the night was very dark and nothing could be seen or heard.\r\nThey had then rushed out into the hall, where Ames had turned the\r\nwindlass which lowered the drawbridge. Mr. Barker had then hurried off\r\nto get the police.\r\n\r\nSuch, in its essentials, was the evidence of the butler.\r\n\r\nThe account of Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, was, so far as it went, a\r\ncorroboration of that of her fellow servant. The housekeeper\u2019s room was\r\nrather nearer to the front of the house than the pantry in which Ames\r\nhad been working. She was preparing to go to bed when the loud ringing\r\nof the bell had attracted her attention. She was a little hard of\r\nhearing. Perhaps that was why she had not heard the shot; but in any\r\ncase the study was a long way off. She remembered hearing some sound\r\nwhich she imagined to be the slamming of a door. That was a good deal\r\nearlier\u2014half an hour at least before the ringing of the bell. When Mr.\r\nAmes ran to the front she went with him. She saw Mr. Barker, very pale\r\nand excited, come out of the study. He intercepted Mrs. Douglas, who\r\nwas coming down the stairs. He entreated her to go back, and she\r\nanswered him, but what she said could not be heard.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake her up! Stay with her!\u201d he had said to Mrs. Allen.\r\n\r\nShe had therefore taken her to the bedroom, and endeavoured to soothe\r\nher. She was greatly excited, trembling all over, but made no other\r\nattempt to go downstairs. She just sat in her dressing gown by her\r\nbedroom fire, with her head sunk in her hands. Mrs. Allen stayed with\r\nher most of the night. As to the other servants, they had all gone to\r\nbed, and the alarm did not reach them until just before the police\r\narrived. They slept at the extreme back of the house, and could not\r\npossibly have heard anything.\r\n\r\nSo far the housekeeper could add nothing on cross-examination save\r\nlamentations and expressions of amazement.\r\n\r\nCecil Barker succeeded Mrs. Allen as a witness. As to the occurrences\r\nof the night before, he had very little to add to what he had already\r\ntold the police. Personally, he was convinced that the murderer had\r\nescaped by the window. The bloodstain was conclusive, in his opinion,\r\non that point. Besides, as the bridge was up, there was no other\r\npossible way of escaping. He could not explain what had become of the\r\nassassin or why he had not taken his bicycle, if it were indeed his. He\r\ncould not possibly have been drowned in the moat, which was at no place\r\nmore than three feet deep.\r\n\r\nIn his own mind he had a very definite theory about the murder. Douglas\r\nwas a reticent man, and there were some chapters in his life of which\r\nhe never spoke. He had emigrated to America when he was a very young\r\nman. He had prospered well, and Barker had first met him in California,\r\nwhere they had become partners in a successful mining claim at a place\r\ncalled Benito Canyon. They had done very well; but Douglas had suddenly\r\nsold out and started for England. He was a widower at that time. Barker\r\nhad afterwards realized his money and come to live in London. Thus they\r\nhad renewed their friendship.\r\n\r\nDouglas had given him the impression that some danger was hanging over\r\nhis head, and he had always looked upon his sudden departure from\r\nCalifornia, and also his renting a house in so quiet a place in\r\nEngland, as being connected with this peril. He imagined that some\r\nsecret society, some implacable organization, was on Douglas\u2019s track,\r\nwhich would never rest until it killed him. Some remarks of his had\r\ngiven him this idea; though he had never told him what the society was,\r\nnor how he had come to offend it. He could only suppose that the legend\r\nupon the placard had some reference to this secret society.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long were you with Douglas in California?\u201d asked Inspector\r\nMacDonald.\r\n\r\n\u201cFive years altogether.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was a bachelor, you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA widower.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you ever heard where his first wife came from?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I remember his saying that she was of German extraction, and I\r\nhave seen her portrait. She was a very beautiful woman. She died of\r\ntyphoid the year before I met him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t associate his past with any particular part of America?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have heard him talk of Chicago. He knew that city well and had\r\nworked there. I have heard him talk of the coal and iron districts. He\r\nhad travelled a good deal in his time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas he a politician? Had this secret society to do with politics?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, he cared nothing about politics.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have no reason to think it was criminal?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, I never met a straighter man in my life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas there anything curious about his life in California?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe liked best to stay and to work at our claim in the mountains. He\r\nwould never go where other men were if he could help it. That\u2019s why I\r\nfirst thought that someone was after him. Then when he left so suddenly\r\nfor Europe I made sure that it was so. I believe that he had a warning\r\nof some sort. Within a week of his leaving half a dozen men were\r\ninquiring for him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat sort of men?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, they were a mighty hard-looking crowd. They came up to the claim\r\nand wanted to know where he was. I told them that he was gone to Europe\r\nand that I did not know where to find him. They meant him no good\u2014it\r\nwas easy to see that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere these men Americans\u2014Californians?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about Californians. They were Americans, all right.\r\nBut they were not miners. I don\u2019t know what they were, and was very\r\nglad to see their backs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was six years ago?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNearer seven.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then you were together five years in California, so that this\r\nbusiness dates back not less than eleven years at the least?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be a very serious feud that would be kept up with such\r\nearnestness for as long as that. It would be no light thing that would\r\ngive rise to it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it shadowed his whole life. It was never quite out of his\r\nmind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if a man had a danger hanging over him, and knew what it was,\r\ndon\u2019t you think he would turn to the police for protection?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe it was some danger that he could not be protected against.\r\nThere\u2019s one thing you should know. He always went about armed. His\r\nrevolver was never out of his pocket. But, by bad luck, he was in his\r\ndressing gown and had left it in the bedroom last night. Once the\r\nbridge was up, I guess he thought he was safe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like these dates a little clearer,\u201d said MacDonald. \u201cIt is\r\nquite six years since Douglas left California. You followed him next\r\nyear, did you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he had been married five years. You must have returned about the\r\ntime of his marriage.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout a month before. I was his best man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you know Mrs. Douglas before her marriage?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I did not. I had been away from England for ten years.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you have seen a good deal of her since.\u201d\r\n\r\nBarker looked sternly at the detective. \u201cI have seen a good deal of\r\n_him_ since,\u201d he answered. \u201cIf I have seen her, it is because you\r\ncannot visit a man without knowing his wife. If you imagine there is\r\nany connection\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI imagine nothing, Mr. Barker. I am bound to make every inquiry which\r\ncan bear upon the case. But I mean no offense.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome inquiries are offensive,\u201d Barker answered angrily.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s only the facts that we want. It is in your interest and\r\neveryone\u2019s interest that they should be cleared up. Did Mr. Douglas\r\nentirely approve your friendship with his wife?\u201d\r\n\r\nBarker grew paler, and his great, strong hands were clasped\r\nconvulsively together. \u201cYou have no right to ask such questions!\u201d he\r\ncried. \u201cWhat has this to do with the matter you are investigating?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI must repeat the question.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I refuse to answer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can refuse to answer; but you must be aware that your refusal is\r\nin itself an answer, for you would not refuse if you had not something\r\nto conceal.\u201d\r\n\r\nBarker stood for a moment with his face set grimly and his strong black\r\neyebrows drawn low in intense thought. Then he looked up with a smile.\r\n\u201cWell, I guess you gentlemen are only doing your clear duty after all,\r\nand I have no right to stand in the way of it. I\u2019d only ask you not to\r\nworry Mrs. Douglas over this matter; for she has enough upon her just\r\nnow. I may tell you that poor Douglas had just one fault in the world,\r\nand that was his jealousy. He was fond of me\u2014no man could be fonder of\r\na friend. And he was devoted to his wife. He loved me to come here, and\r\nwas forever sending for me. And yet if his wife and I talked together\r\nor there seemed any sympathy between us, a kind of wave of jealousy\r\nwould pass over him, and he would be off the handle and saying the\r\nwildest things in a moment. More than once I\u2019ve sworn off coming for\r\nthat reason, and then he would write me such penitent, imploring\r\nletters that I just had to. But you can take it from me, gentlemen, if\r\nit was my last word, that no man ever had a more loving, faithful\r\nwife\u2014and I can say also no friend could be more loyal than I!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was spoken with fervour and feeling, and yet Inspector MacDonald\r\ncould not dismiss the subject.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are aware,\u201d said he, \u201cthat the dead man\u2019s wedding ring has been\r\ntaken from his finger?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it appears,\u201d said Barker.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018appears\u2019? You know it as a fact.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man seemed confused and undecided. \u201cWhen I said \u2018appears\u2019 I meant\r\nthat it was conceivable that he had himself taken off the ring.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe mere fact that the ring should be absent, whoever may have removed\r\nit, would suggest to anyone\u2019s mind, would it not, that the marriage and\r\nthe tragedy were connected?\u201d\r\n\r\nBarker shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cI can\u2019t profess to say what it\r\nmeans,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut if you mean to hint that it could reflect in\r\nany way upon this lady\u2019s honour\u201d\u2014his eyes blazed for an instant, and\r\nthen with an evident effort he got a grip upon his own emotions\u2014\u201cwell,\r\nyou are on the wrong track, that\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve anything else to ask you at present,\u201d said\r\nMacDonald, coldly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was one small point,\u201d remarked Sherlock Holmes. \u201cWhen you\r\nentered the room there was only a candle lighted on the table, was\r\nthere not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that was so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy its light you saw that some terrible incident had occurred?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou at once rang for help?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it arrived very speedily?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWithin a minute or so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet when they arrived they found that the candle was out and that\r\nthe lamp had been lighted. That seems very remarkable.\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain Barker showed some signs of indecision. \u201cI don\u2019t see that it was\r\nremarkable, Mr. Holmes,\u201d he answered after a pause. \u201cThe candle threw a\r\nvery bad light. My first thought was to get a better one. The lamp was\r\non the table; so I lit it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd blew out the candle?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes asked no further question, and Barker, with a deliberate look\r\nfrom one to the other of us, which had, as it seemed to me, something\r\nof defiance in it, turned and left the room.\r\n\r\nInspector MacDonald had sent up a note to the effect that he would wait\r\nupon Mrs. Douglas in her room; but she had replied that she would meet\r\nus in the dining room. She entered now, a tall and beautiful woman of\r\nthirty, reserved and self-possessed to a remarkable degree, very\r\ndifferent from the tragic and distracted figure I had pictured. It is\r\ntrue that her face was pale and drawn, like that of one who has endured\r\na great shock; but her manner was composed, and the finely moulded hand\r\nwhich she rested upon the edge of the table was as steady as my own.\r\nHer sad, appealing eyes travelled from one to the other of us with a\r\ncuriously inquisitive expression. That questioning gaze transformed\r\nitself suddenly into abrupt speech.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you found anything out yet?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\nWas it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than\r\nof hope in the question?\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have taken every possible step, Mrs. Douglas,\u201d said the inspector.\r\n\u201cYou may rest assured that nothing will be neglected.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSpare no money,\u201d she said in a dead, even tone. \u201cIt is my desire that\r\nevery possible effort should be made.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you can tell us something which may throw some light upon the\r\nmatter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear not; but all I know is at your service.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have heard from Mr. Cecil Barker that you did not actually see\u2014that\r\nyou were never in the room where the tragedy occurred?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, he turned me back upon the stairs. He begged me to return to my\r\nroom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. You had heard the shot, and you had at once come down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI put on my dressing gown and then came down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long was it after hearing the shot that you were stopped on the\r\nstair by Mr. Barker?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may have been a couple of minutes. It is so hard to reckon time at\r\nsuch a moment. He implored me not to go on. He assured me that I could\r\ndo nothing. Then Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, led me upstairs again. It\r\nwas all like some dreadful dream.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you give us any idea how long your husband had been downstairs\r\nbefore you heard the shot?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I cannot say. He went from his dressing room, and I did not hear\r\nhim go. He did the round of the house every night, for he was nervous\r\nof fire. It is the only thing that I have ever known him nervous of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is just the point which I want to come to, Mrs. Douglas. You have\r\nknown your husband only in England, have you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, we have been married five years.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you heard him speak of anything which occurred in America and\r\nmight bring some danger upon him?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Douglas thought earnestly before she answered. \u201cYes,\u201d she said at\r\nlast, \u201cI have always felt that there was a danger hanging over him. He\r\nrefused to discuss it with me. It was not from want of confidence in\r\nme\u2014there was the most complete love and confidence between us\u2014but it\r\nwas out of his desire to keep all alarm away from me. He thought I\r\nshould brood over it if I knew all, and so he was silent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you know it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Douglas\u2019s face lit with a quick smile. \u201cCan a husband ever carry\r\nabout a secret all his life and a woman who loves him have no suspicion\r\nof it? I knew it by his refusal to talk about some episodes in his\r\nAmerican life. I knew it by certain precautions he took. I knew it by\r\ncertain words he let fall. I knew it by the way he looked at unexpected\r\nstrangers. I was perfectly certain that he had some powerful enemies,\r\nthat he believed they were on his track, and that he was always on his\r\nguard against them. I was so sure of it that for years I have been\r\nterrified if ever he came home later than was expected.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMight I ask,\u201d asked Holmes, \u201cwhat the words were which attracted your\r\nattention?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Valley of Fear,\u201d the lady answered. \u201cThat was an expression he has\r\nused when I questioned him. \u2018I have been in the Valley of Fear. I am\r\nnot out of it yet.\u2019\u2014\u2018Are we never to get out of the Valley of Fear?\u2019 I\r\nhave asked him when I have seen him more serious than usual. \u2018Sometimes\r\nI think that we never shall,\u2019 he has answered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely you asked him what he meant by the Valley of Fear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did; but his face would become very grave and he would shake his\r\nhead. \u2018It is bad enough that one of us should have been in its shadow,\u2019\r\nhe said. \u2018Please God it shall never fall upon you!\u2019 It was some real\r\nvalley in which he had lived and in which something terrible had\r\noccurred to him, of that I am certain; but I can tell you no more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he never mentioned any names?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he was delirious with fever once when he had his hunting accident\r\nthree years ago. Then I remember that there was a name that came\r\ncontinually to his lips. He spoke it with anger and a sort of horror.\r\nMcGinty was the name\u2014Bodymaster McGinty. I asked him when he recovered\r\nwho Bodymaster McGinty was, and whose body he was master of. \u2018Never of\r\nmine, thank God!\u2019 he answered with a laugh, and that was all I could\r\nget from him. But there is a connection between Bodymaster McGinty and\r\nthe Valley of Fear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is one other point,\u201d said Inspector MacDonald. \u201cYou met Mr.\r\nDouglas in a boarding house in London, did you not, and became engaged\r\nto him there? Was there any romance, anything secret or mysterious,\r\nabout the wedding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was romance. There is always romance. There was nothing\r\nmysterious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe had no rival?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I was quite free.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have heard, no doubt, that his wedding ring has been taken. Does\r\nthat suggest anything to you? Suppose that some enemy of his old life\r\nhad tracked him down and committed this crime, what possible reason\r\ncould he have for taking his wedding ring?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor an instant I could have sworn that the faintest shadow of a smile\r\nflickered over the woman\u2019s lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: For an instant I could have sworn that the faintest\r\nshadow of a smile flickered over the woman\u2019s lips.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI really cannot tell,\u201d she answered. \u201cIt is certainly a most\r\nextraordinary thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we will not detain you any longer, and we are sorry to have put\r\nyou to this trouble at such a time,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cThere are\r\nsome other points, no doubt; but we can refer to you as they arise.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe rose, and I was again conscious of that quick, questioning glance\r\nwith which she had just surveyed us. \u201cWhat impression has my evidence\r\nmade upon you?\u201d The question might as well have been spoken. Then, with\r\na bow, she swept from the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful woman\u2014a very beautiful woman,\u201d said MacDonald\r\nthoughtfully, after the door had closed behind her. \u201cThis man Barker\r\nhas certainly been down here a good deal. He is a man who might be\r\nattractive to a woman. He admits that the dead man was jealous, and\r\nmaybe he knew best himself what cause he had for jealousy. Then there\u2019s\r\nthat wedding ring. You can\u2019t get past that. The man who tears a wedding\r\nring off a dead man\u2019s\u2014What do you say to it, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend had sat with his head upon his hands, sunk in the deepest\r\nthought. Now he rose and rang the bell. \u201cAmes,\u201d he said, when the\r\nbutler entered, \u201cwhere is Mr. Cecil Barker now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe came back in a moment to say that Barker was in the garden.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you remember, Ames, what Mr. Barker had on his feet last night\r\nwhen you joined him in the study?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Mr. Holmes. He had a pair of bedroom slippers. I brought him his\r\nboots when he went for the police.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere are the slippers now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are still under the chair in the hall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good, Ames. It is, of course, important for us to know which\r\ntracks may be Mr. Barker\u2019s and which from outside.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I may say that I noticed that the slippers were stained with\r\nblood\u2014so indeed were my own.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is natural enough, considering the condition of the room. Very\r\ngood, Ames. We will ring if we want you.\u201d\r\n\r\nA few minutes later we were in the study. Holmes had brought with him\r\nthe carpet slippers from the hall. As Ames had observed, the soles of\r\nboth were dark with blood.\r\n\r\n\u201cStrange!\u201d murmured Holmes, as he stood in the light of the window and\r\nexamined them minutely. \u201cVery strange indeed!\u201d\r\n\r\nStooping with one of his quick feline pounces, he placed the slipper\r\nupon the blood mark on the sill. It exactly corresponded. He smiled in\r\nsilence at his colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe inspector was transfigured with excitement. His native accent\r\nrattled like a stick upon railings.\r\n\r\n\u201cMan,\u201d he cried, \u201cthere\u2019s not a doubt of it! Barker has just marked the\r\nwindow himself. It\u2019s a good deal broader than any bootmark. I mind that\r\nyou said it was a splay-foot, and here\u2019s the explanation. But what\u2019s\r\nthe game, Mr. Holmes\u2014what\u2019s the game?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, what\u2019s the game?\u201d my friend repeated thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nWhite Mason chuckled and rubbed his fat hands together in his\r\nprofessional satisfaction. \u201cI said it was a snorter!\u201d he cried. \u201cAnd a\r\nreal snorter it is!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\nA Dawning Light\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three detectives had many matters of detail into which to inquire;\r\nso I returned alone to our modest quarters at the village inn. But\r\nbefore doing so I took a stroll in the curious old-world garden which\r\nflanked the house. Rows of very ancient yew trees cut into strange\r\ndesigns girded it round. Inside was a beautiful stretch of lawn with an\r\nold sundial in the middle, the whole effect so soothing and restful\r\nthat it was welcome to my somewhat jangled nerves.\r\n\r\nIn that deeply peaceful atmosphere one could forget, or remember only\r\nas some fantastic nightmare, that darkened study with the sprawling,\r\nbloodstained figure on the floor. And yet, as I strolled round it and\r\ntried to steep my soul in its gentle balm, a strange incident occurred,\r\nwhich brought me back to the tragedy and left a sinister impression in\r\nmy mind.\r\n\r\nI have said that a decoration of yew trees circled the garden. At the\r\nend farthest from the house they thickened into a continuous hedge. On\r\nthe other side of this hedge, concealed from the eyes of anyone\r\napproaching from the direction of the house, there was a stone seat. As\r\nI approached the spot I was aware of voices, some remark in the deep\r\ntones of a man, answered by a little ripple of feminine laughter.\r\n\r\nAn instant later I had come round the end of the hedge and my eyes lit\r\nupon Mrs. Douglas and the man Barker before they were aware of my\r\npresence. Her appearance gave me a shock. In the dining-room she had\r\nbeen demure and discreet. Now all pretense of grief had passed away\r\nfrom her. Her eyes shone with the joy of living, and her face still\r\nquivered with amusement at some remark of her companion. He sat\r\nforward, his hands clasped and his forearms on his knees, with an\r\nanswering smile upon his bold, handsome face. In an instant\u2014but it was\r\njust one instant too late\u2014they resumed their solemn masks as my figure\r\ncame into view. A hurried word or two passed between them, and then\r\nBarker rose and came towards me.\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cbut am I addressing Dr. Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\nI bowed with a coldness which showed, I dare say, very plainly the\r\nimpression which had been produced upon my mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe thought that it was probably you, as your friendship with Mr.\r\nSherlock Holmes is so well known. Would you mind coming over and\r\nspeaking to Mrs. Douglas for one instant?\u201d\r\n\r\nI followed him with a dour face. Very clearly I could see in my mind\u2019s\r\neye that shattered figure on the floor. Here within a few hours of the\r\ntragedy were his wife and his nearest friend laughing together behind a\r\nbush in the garden which had been his. I greeted the lady with reserve.\r\nI had grieved with her grief in the dining room. Now I met her\r\nappealing gaze with an unresponsive eye.\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear that you think me callous and hard-hearted,\u201d said she.\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders. \u201cIt is no business of mine,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps some day you will do me justice. If you only realized\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no need why Dr. Watson should realize,\u201d said Barker quickly.\r\n\u201cAs he has himself said, it is no possible business of his.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said I, \u201cand so I will beg leave to resume my walk.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne moment, Dr. Watson,\u201d cried the woman in a pleading voice. \u201cThere\r\nis one question which you can answer with more authority than anyone\r\nelse in the world, and it may make a very great difference to me. You\r\nknow Mr. Holmes and his relations with the police better than anyone\r\nelse can. Supposing that a matter were brought confidentially to his\r\nknowledge, is it absolutely necessary that he should pass it on to the\r\ndetectives?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s it,\u201d said Barker eagerly. \u201cIs he on his own or is he\r\nentirely in with them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know that I should be justified in discussing such a\r\npoint.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg\u2014I implore that you will, Dr. Watson! I assure you that you will\r\nbe helping us\u2014helping me greatly if you will guide us on that point.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was such a ring of sincerity in the woman\u2019s voice that for the\r\ninstant I forgot all about her levity and was moved only to do her\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Holmes is an independent investigator,\u201d I said. \u201cHe is his own\r\nmaster, and would act as his own judgment directed. At the same time,\r\nhe would naturally feel loyalty towards the officials who were working\r\non the same case, and he would not conceal from them anything which\r\nwould help them in bringing a criminal to justice. Beyond this I can\r\nsay nothing, and I would refer you to Mr. Holmes himself if you wanted\r\nfuller information.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo saying I raised my hat and went upon my way, leaving them still\r\nseated behind that concealing hedge. I looked back as I rounded the far\r\nend of it, and saw that they were still talking very earnestly\r\ntogether, and, as they were gazing after me, it was clear that it was\r\nour interview that was the subject of their debate.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish none of their confidences,\u201d said Holmes, when I reported to him\r\nwhat had occurred. He had spent the whole afternoon at the Manor House\r\nin consultation with his two colleagues, and returned about five with a\r\nravenous appetite for a high tea which I had ordered for him. \u201cNo\r\nconfidences, Watson; for they are mighty awkward if it comes to an\r\narrest for conspiracy and murder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think it will come to that?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was in his most cheerful and debonair humour. \u201cMy dear Watson, when\r\nI have exterminated that fourth egg I shall be ready to put you in\r\ntouch with the whole situation. I don\u2019t say that we have fathomed\r\nit\u2014far from it\u2014but when we have traced the missing dumb-bell\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe dumb-bell!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me, Watson, is it possible that you have not penetrated the fact\r\nthat the case hangs upon the missing dumb-bell? Well, well, you need\r\nnot be downcast; for between ourselves I don\u2019t think that either\r\nInspector Mac or the excellent local practitioner has grasped the\r\noverwhelming importance of this incident. One dumb-bell, Watson!\r\nConsider an athlete with one dumb-bell! Picture to yourself the\r\nunilateral development, the imminent danger of a spinal curvature.\r\nShocking, Watson, shocking!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe sat with his mouth full of toast and his eyes sparkling with\r\nmischief, watching my intellectual entanglement. The mere sight of his\r\nexcellent appetite was an assurance of success; for I had very clear\r\nrecollections of days and nights without a thought of food, when his\r\nbaffled mind had chafed before some problem while his thin, eager\r\nfeatures became more attenuated with the asceticism of complete mental\r\nconcentration. Finally he lit his pipe, and sitting in the inglenook of\r\nthe old village inn he talked slowly and at random about his case,\r\nrather as one who thinks aloud than as one who makes a considered\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n\u201cA lie, Watson\u2014a great, big, thumping, obtrusive, uncompromising\r\nlie\u2014that\u2019s what meets us on the threshold! There is our starting point.\r\nThe whole story told by Barker is a lie. But Barker\u2019s story is\r\ncorroborated by Mrs. Douglas. Therefore she is lying also. They are\r\nboth lying, and in a conspiracy. So now we have the clear problem. Why\r\nare they lying, and what is the truth which they are trying so hard to\r\nconceal? Let us try, Watson, you and I, if we can get behind the lie\r\nand reconstruct the truth.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do I know that they are lying? Because it is a clumsy fabrication\r\nwhich simply could not be true. Consider! According to the story given\r\nto us, the assassin had less than a minute after the murder had been\r\ncommitted to take that ring, which was under another ring, from the\r\ndead man\u2019s finger, to replace the other ring\u2014a thing which he would\r\nsurely never have done\u2014and to put that singular card beside his victim.\r\nI say that this was obviously impossible.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may argue\u2014but I have too much respect for your judgment, Watson,\r\nto think that you will do so\u2014that the ring may have been taken before\r\nthe man was killed. The fact that the candle had been lit only a short\r\ntime shows that there had been no lengthy interview. Was Douglas, from\r\nwhat we hear of his fearless character, a man who would be likely to\r\ngive up his wedding ring at such short notice, or could we conceive of\r\nhis giving it up at all? No, no, Watson, the assassin was alone with\r\nthe dead man for some time with the lamp lit. Of that I have no doubt\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the gunshot was apparently the cause of death. Therefore the shot\r\nmust have been fired some time earlier than we are told. But there\r\ncould be no mistake about such a matter as that. We are in the\r\npresence, therefore, of a deliberate conspiracy upon the part of the\r\ntwo people who heard the gunshot\u2014of the man Barker and of the woman\r\nDouglas. When on the top of this I am able to show that the blood mark\r\non the windowsill was deliberately placed there by Barker, in order to\r\ngive a false clue to the police, you will admit that the case grows\r\ndark against him.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow we have to ask ourselves at what hour the murder actually did\r\noccur. Up to half-past ten the servants were moving about the house; so\r\nit was certainly not before that time. At a quarter to eleven they had\r\nall gone to their rooms with the exception of Ames, who was in the\r\npantry. I have been trying some experiments after you left us this\r\nafternoon, and I find that no noise which MacDonald can make in the\r\nstudy can penetrate to me in the pantry when the doors are all shut.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is otherwise, however, from the housekeeper\u2019s room. It is not so\r\nfar down the corridor, and from it I could vaguely hear a voice when it\r\nwas very loudly raised. The sound from a shotgun is to some extent\r\nmuffled when the discharge is at very close range, as it undoubtedly\r\nwas in this instance. It would not be very loud, and yet in the silence\r\nof the night it should have easily penetrated to Mrs. Allen\u2019s room. She\r\nis, as she has told us, somewhat deaf; but none the less she mentioned\r\nin her evidence that she did hear something like a door slamming half\r\nan hour before the alarm was given. Half an hour before the alarm was\r\ngiven would be a quarter to eleven. I have no doubt that what she heard\r\nwas the report of the gun, and that this was the real instant of the\r\nmurder.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf this is so, we have now to determine what Barker and Mrs. Douglas,\r\npresuming that they are not the actual murderers, could have been doing\r\nfrom quarter to eleven, when the sound of the shot brought them down,\r\nuntil quarter past eleven, when they rang the bell and summoned the\r\nservants. What were they doing, and why did they not instantly give the\r\nalarm? That is the question which faces us, and when it has been\r\nanswered we shall surely have gone some way to solve our problem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am convinced myself,\u201d said I, \u201cthat there is an understanding\r\nbetween those two people. She must be a heartless creature to sit\r\nlaughing at some jest within a few hours of her husband\u2019s murder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. She does not shine as a wife even in her own account of what\r\noccurred. I am not a whole-souled admirer of womankind, as you are\r\naware, Watson, but my experience of life has taught me that there are\r\nfew wives, having any regard for their husbands, who would let any\r\nman\u2019s spoken word stand between them and that husband\u2019s dead body.\r\nShould I ever marry, Watson, I should hope to inspire my wife with some\r\nfeeling which would prevent her from being walked off by a housekeeper\r\nwhen my corpse was lying within a few yards of her. It was badly\r\nstage-managed; for even the rawest investigators must be struck by the\r\nabsence of the usual feminine ululation. If there had been nothing\r\nelse, this incident alone would have suggested a prearranged conspiracy\r\nto my mind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think then, definitely, that Barker and Mrs. Douglas are guilty of\r\nthe murder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is an appalling directness about your questions, Watson,\u201d said\r\nHolmes, shaking his pipe at me. \u201cThey come at me like bullets. If you\r\nput it that Mrs. Douglas and Barker know the truth about the murder,\r\nand are conspiring to conceal it, then I can give you a whole-souled\r\nanswer. I am sure they do. But your more deadly proposition is not so\r\nclear. Let us for a moment consider the difficulties which stand in the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will suppose that this couple are united by the bonds of a guilty\r\nlove, and that they have determined to get rid of the man who stands\r\nbetween them. It is a large supposition; for discreet inquiry among\r\nservants and others has failed to corroborate it in any way. On the\r\ncontrary, there is a good deal of evidence that the Douglases were very\r\nattached to each other.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat, I am sure, cannot be true,\u201d said I, thinking of the beautiful\r\nsmiling face in the garden.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, at least they gave that impression. However, we will suppose\r\nthat they are an extraordinarily astute couple, who deceive everyone\r\nupon this point, and conspire to murder the husband. He happens to be a\r\nman over whose head some danger hangs\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have only their word for that.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes looked thoughtful. \u201cI see, Watson. You are sketching out a\r\ntheory by which everything they say from the beginning is false.\r\nAccording to your idea, there was never any hidden menace, or secret\r\nsociety, or Valley of Fear, or Boss MacSomebody, or anything else.\r\nWell, that is a good sweeping generalization. Let us see what that\r\nbrings us to. They invent this theory to account for the crime. They\r\nthen play up to the idea by leaving this bicycle in the park as proof\r\nof the existence of some outsider. The stain on the windowsill conveys\r\nthe same idea. So does the card on the body, which might have been\r\nprepared in the house. That all fits into your hypothesis, Watson. But\r\nnow we come on the nasty, angular, uncompromising bits which won\u2019t slip\r\ninto their places. Why a cut-off shotgun of all weapons\u2014and an American\r\none at that? How could they be so sure that the sound of it would not\r\nbring someone on to them? It\u2019s a mere chance as it is that Mrs. Allen\r\ndid not start out to inquire for the slamming door. Why did your guilty\r\ncouple do all this, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI confess that I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen again, if a woman and her lover conspire to murder a husband, are\r\nthey going to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously removing his\r\nwedding ring after his death? Does that strike you as very probable,\r\nWatson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it does not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd once again, if the thought of leaving a bicycle concealed outside\r\nhad occurred to you, would it really have seemed worth doing when the\r\ndullest detective would naturally say this is an obvious blind, as the\r\nbicycle is the first thing which the fugitive needed in order to make\r\nhis escape.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can conceive of no explanation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet there should be no combination of events for which the wit of\r\nman cannot conceive an explanation. Simply as a mental exercise,\r\nwithout any assertion that it is true, let me indicate a possible line\r\nof thought. It is, I admit, mere imagination; but how often is\r\nimagination the mother of truth?\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will suppose that there was a guilty secret, a really shameful\r\nsecret in the life of this man Douglas. This leads to his murder by\r\nsomeone who is, we will suppose, an avenger, someone from outside. This\r\navenger, for some reason which I confess I am still at a loss to\r\nexplain, took the dead man\u2019s wedding ring. The vendetta might\r\nconceivably date back to the man\u2019s first marriage, and the ring be\r\ntaken for some such reason.\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore this avenger got away, Barker and the wife had reached the\r\nroom. The assassin convinced them that any attempt to arrest him would\r\nlead to the publication of some hideous scandal. They were converted to\r\nthis idea, and preferred to let him go. For this purpose they probably\r\nlowered the bridge, which can be done quite noiselessly, and then\r\nraised it again. He made his escape, and for some reason thought that\r\nhe could do so more safely on foot than on the bicycle. He therefore\r\nleft his machine where it would not be discovered until he had got\r\nsafely away. So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we\r\nnot?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is possible, no doubt,\u201d said I, with some reserve.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have to remember, Watson, that whatever occurred is certainly\r\nsomething very extraordinary. Well, now, to continue our supposititious\r\ncase, the couple\u2014not necessarily a guilty couple\u2014realize after the\r\nmurderer is gone that they have placed themselves in a position in\r\nwhich it may be difficult for them to prove that they did not\r\nthemselves either do the deed or connive at it. They rapidly and rather\r\nclumsily met the situation. The mark was put by Barker\u2019s bloodstained\r\nslipper upon the windowsill to suggest how the fugitive got away. They\r\nobviously were the two who must have heard the sound of the gun; so\r\nthey gave the alarm exactly as they would have done, but a good half\r\nhour after the event.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how do you propose to prove all this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if there were an outsider, he may be traced and taken. That\r\nwould be the most effective of all proofs. But if not\u2014well, the\r\nresources of science are far from being exhausted. I think that an\r\nevening alone in that study would help me much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn evening alone!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI propose to go up there presently. I have arranged it with the\r\nestimable Ames, who is by no means wholehearted about Barker. I shall\r\nsit in that room and see if its atmosphere brings me inspiration. I\u2019m a\r\nbeliever in the genius loci. You smile, Friend Watson. Well, we shall\r\nsee. By the way, you have that big umbrella of yours, have you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll borrow that if I may.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly\u2014but what a wretched weapon! If there is danger\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing serious, my dear Watson, or I should certainly ask for your\r\nassistance. But I\u2019ll take the umbrella. At present I am only awaiting\r\nthe return of our colleagues from Tunbridge Wells, where they are at\r\npresent engaged in trying for a likely owner to the bicycle.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was nightfall before Inspector MacDonald and White Mason came back\r\nfrom their expedition, and they arrived exultant, reporting a great\r\nadvance in our investigation.\r\n\r\n\u201cMan, I\u2019ll admeet that I had my doubts if there was ever an outsider,\u201d\r\nsaid MacDonald, \u201cbut that\u2019s all past now. We\u2019ve had the bicycle\r\nidentified, and we have a description of our man; so that\u2019s a long step\r\non our journey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt sounds to me like the beginning of the end,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI\u2019m sure\r\nI congratulate you both with all my heart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I started from the fact that Mr. Douglas had seemed disturbed\r\nsince the day before, when he had been at Tunbridge Wells. It was at\r\nTunbridge Wells then that he had become conscious of some danger. It\r\nwas clear, therefore, that if a man had come over with a bicycle it was\r\nfrom Tunbridge Wells that he might be expected to have come. We took\r\nthe bicycle over with us and showed it at the hotels. It was identified\r\nat once by the manager of the Eagle Commercial as belonging to a man\r\nnamed Hargrave, who had taken a room there two days before. This\r\nbicycle and a small valise were his whole belongings. He had registered\r\nhis name as coming from London, but had given no address. The valise\r\nwas London made, and the contents were British; but the man himself was\r\nundoubtedly an American.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said Holmes gleefully, \u201cyou have indeed done some solid\r\nwork while I have been sitting spinning theories with my friend! It\u2019s a\r\nlesson in being practical, Mr. Mac.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, it\u2019s just that, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said the inspector with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut this may all fit in with your theories,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat may or may not be. But let us hear the end, Mr. Mac. Was there\r\nnothing to identify this man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo little that it was evident that he had carefully guarded himself\r\nagainst identification. There were no papers or letters, and no marking\r\nupon the clothes. A cycle map of the county lay on his bedroom table.\r\nHe had left the hotel after breakfast yesterday morning on his bicycle,\r\nand no more was heard of him until our inquiries.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what puzzles me, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said White Mason. \u201cIf the fellow\r\ndid not want the hue and cry raised over him, one would imagine that he\r\nwould have returned and remained at the hotel as an inoffensive\r\ntourist. As it is, he must know that he will be reported to the police\r\nby the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be connected with\r\nthe murder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo one would imagine. Still, he has been justified of his wisdom up to\r\ndate, at any rate, since he has not been taken. But his\r\ndescription\u2014what of that?\u201d\r\n\r\nMacDonald referred to his notebook. \u201cHere we have it so far as they\r\ncould give it. They don\u2019t seem to have taken any very particular stock\r\nof him; but still the porter, the clerk, and the chambermaid are all\r\nagreed that this about covers the points. He was a man about five foot\r\nnine in height, fifty or so years of age, his hair slightly grizzled, a\r\ngrayish moustache, a curved nose, and a face which all of them\r\ndescribed as fierce and forbidding.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, bar the expression, that might almost be a description of\r\nDouglas himself,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHe is just over fifty, with grizzled\r\nhair and moustache, and about the same height. Did you get anything\r\nelse?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was dressed in a heavy gray suit with a reefer jacket, and he wore\r\na short yellow overcoat and a soft cap.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about the shotgun?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is less than two feet long. It could very well have fitted into his\r\nvalise. He could have carried it inside his overcoat without\r\ndifficulty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how do you consider that all this bears upon the general case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said MacDonald, \u201cwhen we have got our man\u2014and you\r\nmay be sure that I had his description on the wires within five minutes\r\nof hearing it\u2014we shall be better able to judge. But, even as it stands,\r\nwe have surely gone a long way. We know that an American calling\r\nhimself Hargrave came to Tunbridge Wells two days ago with bicycle and\r\nvalise. In the latter was a sawed-off shotgun; so he came with the\r\ndeliberate purpose of crime. Yesterday morning he set off for this\r\nplace on his bicycle, with his gun concealed in his overcoat. No one\r\nsaw him arrive, so far as we can learn; but he need not pass through\r\nthe village to reach the park gates, and there are many cyclists upon\r\nthe road. Presumably he at once concealed his cycle among the laurels\r\nwhere it was found, and possibly lurked there himself, with his eye on\r\nthe house, waiting for Mr. Douglas to come out. The shotgun is a\r\nstrange weapon to use inside a house; but he had intended to use it\r\noutside, and there it has very obvious advantages, as it would be\r\nimpossible to miss with it, and the sound of shots is so common in an\r\nEnglish sporting neighbourhood that no particular notice would be\r\ntaken.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is all very clear,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Douglas did not appear. What was he to do next? He left his\r\nbicycle and approached the house in the twilight. He found the bridge\r\ndown and no one about. He took his chance, intending, no doubt, to make\r\nsome excuse if he met anyone. He met no one. He slipped into the first\r\nroom that he saw, and concealed himself behind the curtain. Thence he\r\ncould see the drawbridge go up, and he knew that his only escape was\r\nthrough the moat. He waited until quarter-past eleven, when Mr. Douglas\r\nupon his usual nightly round came into the room. He shot him and\r\nescaped, as arranged. He was aware that the bicycle would be described\r\nby the hotel people and be a clue against him; so he left it there and\r\nmade his way by some other means to London or to some safe hiding place\r\nwhich he had already arranged. How is that, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Mac, it is very good and very clear so far as it goes. That\r\nis your end of the story. My end is that the crime was committed half\r\nan hour earlier than reported; that Mrs. Douglas and Barker are both in\r\na conspiracy to conceal something; that they aided the murderer\u2019s\r\nescape\u2014or at least that they reached the room before he escaped\u2014and\r\nthat they fabricated evidence of his escape through the window, whereas\r\nin all probability they had themselves let him go by lowering the\r\nbridge. That\u2019s my reading of the first half.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two detectives shook their heads.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, if this is true, we only tumble out of one mystery\r\ninto another,\u201d said the London inspector.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd in some ways a worse one,\u201d added White Mason. \u201cThe lady has never\r\nbeen in America in all her life. What possible connection could she\r\nhave with an American assassin which would cause her to shelter him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI freely admit the difficulties,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI propose to make a\r\nlittle investigation of my own to-night, and it is just possible that\r\nit may contribute something to the common cause.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan we help you, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no! Darkness and Dr. Watson\u2019s umbrella\u2014my wants are simple. And\r\nAmes, the faithful Ames, no doubt he will stretch a point for me. All\r\nmy lines of thought lead me back invariably to the one basic\r\nquestion\u2014why should an athletic man develop his frame upon so unnatural\r\nan instrument as a single dumb-bell?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was late that night when Holmes returned from his solitary\r\nexcursion. We slept in a double-bedded room, which was the best that\r\nthe little country inn could do for us. I was already asleep when I was\r\npartly awakened by his entrance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Holmes,\u201d I murmured, \u201chave you found anything out?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stood beside me in silence, his candle in his hand. Then the tall,\r\nlean figure inclined towards me. \u201cI say, Watson,\u201d he whispered, \u201cwould\r\nyou be afraid to sleep in the same room with a lunatic, a man with\r\nsoftening of the brain, an idiot whose mind has lost its grip?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \u201cWatson, would you be afraid to sleep in the same room\r\nwith a lunatic.\u201d]\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in the least,\u201d I answered in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s lucky,\u201d he said, and not another word would he utter that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\nThe Solution\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning, after breakfast, we found Inspector MacDonald and White\r\nMason seated in close consultation in the small parlour of the local\r\npolice sergeant. On the table in front of them were piled a number of\r\nletters and telegrams, which they were carefully sorting and docketing.\r\nThree had been placed on one side.\r\n\r\n\u201cStill on the track of the elusive bicyclist?\u201d Holmes asked cheerfully.\r\n\u201cWhat is the latest news of the ruffian?\u201d\r\n\r\nMacDonald pointed ruefully to his heap of correspondence.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is at present reported from Leicester, Nottingham, Southampton,\r\nDerby, East Ham, Richmond, and fourteen other places. In three of\r\nthem\u2014East Ham, Leicester, and Liverpool\u2014there is a clear case against\r\nhim, and he has actually been arrested. The country seems to be full of\r\nthe fugitives with yellow coats.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me!\u201d said Holmes sympathetically. \u201cNow, Mr. Mac and you, Mr.\r\nWhite Mason, I wish to give you a very earnest piece of advice. When I\r\nwent into this case with you I bargained, as you will no doubt\r\nremember, that I should not present you with half-proved theories, but\r\nthat I should retain and work out my own ideas until I had satisfied\r\nmyself that they were correct. For this reason I am not at the present\r\nmoment telling you all that is in my mind. On the other hand, I said\r\nthat I would play the game fairly by you, and I do not think it is a\r\nfair game to allow you for one unnecessary moment to waste your\r\nenergies upon a profitless task. Therefore I am here to advise you this\r\nmorning, and my advice to you is summed up in three words\u2014abandon the\r\ncase.\u201d\r\n\r\nMacDonald and White Mason stared in amazement at their celebrated\r\ncolleague.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou consider it hopeless!\u201d cried the inspector.\r\n\r\n\u201cI consider your case to be hopeless. I do not consider that it is\r\nhopeless to arrive at the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut this cyclist. He is not an invention. We have his description, his\r\nvalise, his bicycle. The fellow must be somewhere. Why should we not\r\nget him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, no doubt he is somewhere, and no doubt we shall get him; but\r\nI would not have you waste your energies in East Ham or Liverpool. I am\r\nsure that we can find some shorter cut to a result.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are holding something back. It\u2019s hardly fair of you, Mr. Holmes.\u201d\r\nThe inspector was annoyed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know my methods of work, Mr. Mac. But I will hold it back for the\r\nshortest time possible. I only wish to verify my details in one way,\r\nwhich can very readily be done, and then I make my bow and return to\r\nLondon, leaving my results entirely at your service. I owe you too much\r\nto act otherwise; for in all my experience I cannot recall any more\r\nsingular and interesting study.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is clean beyond me, Mr. Holmes. We saw you when we returned from\r\nTunbridge Wells last night, and you were in general agreement with our\r\nresults. What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea\r\nof the case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, since you ask me, I spent, as I told you that I would, some\r\nhours last night at the Manor House.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what happened?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, I can only give you a very general answer to that for the moment.\r\nBy the way, I have been reading a short but clear and interesting\r\naccount of the old building, purchasable at the modest sum of one penny\r\nfrom the local tobacconist.\u201d\r\n\r\nHere Holmes drew a small tract, embellished with a rude engraving of\r\nthe ancient Manor House, from his waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt immensely adds to the zest of an investigation, my dear Mr. Mac,\r\nwhen one is in conscious sympathy with the historical atmosphere of\r\none\u2019s surroundings. Don\u2019t look so impatient; for I assure you that even\r\nso bald an account as this raises some sort of picture of the past in\r\none\u2019s mind. Permit me to give you a sample. \u2018Erected in the fifth year\r\nof the reign of James I, and standing upon the site of a much older\r\nbuilding, the Manor House of Birlstone presents one of the finest\r\nsurviving examples of the moated Jacobean residence\u2014\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are making fools of us, Mr. Holmes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTut, tut, Mr. Mac!\u2014the first sign of temper I have detected in you.\r\nWell, I won\u2019t read it verbatim, since you feel so strongly upon the\r\nsubject. But when I tell you that there is some account of the taking\r\nof the place by a parliamentary colonel in 1644, of the concealment of\r\nCharles for several days in the course of the Civil War, and finally of\r\na visit there by the second George, you will admit that there are\r\nvarious associations of interest connected with this ancient house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt it, Mr. Holmes; but that is no business of ours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it not? Is it not? Breadth of view, my dear Mr. Mac, is one of the\r\nessentials of our profession. The interplay of ideas and the oblique\r\nuses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest. You will excuse\r\nthese remarks from one who, though a mere connoisseur of crime, is\r\nstill rather older and perhaps more experienced than yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m the first to admit that,\u201d said the detective heartily. \u201cYou get to\r\nyour point, I admit; but you have such a deuced round-the-corner way of\r\ndoing it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well, I\u2019ll drop past history and get down to present-day facts.\r\nI called last night, as I have already said, at the Manor House. I did\r\nnot see either Barker or Mrs. Douglas. I saw no necessity to disturb\r\nthem; but I was pleased to hear that the lady was not visibly pining\r\nand that she had partaken of an excellent dinner. My visit was\r\nspecially made to the good Mr. Ames, with whom I exchanged some\r\namiabilities, which culminated in his allowing me, without reference to\r\nanyone else, to sit alone for a time in the study.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! With that?\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, everything is now in order. You gave permission for that, Mr.\r\nMac, as I am informed. The room was in its normal state, and in it I\r\npassed an instructive quarter of an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, not to make a mystery of so simple a matter, I was looking for\r\nthe missing dumb-bell. It has always bulked rather large in my estimate\r\nof the case. I ended by finding it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, there we come to the edge of the unexplored. Let me go a little\r\nfurther, a very little further, and I will promise that you shall share\r\neverything that I know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re bound to take you on your own terms,\u201d said the inspector;\r\n\u201cbut when it comes to telling us to abandon the case\u2014why in the name of\r\ngoodness should we abandon the case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the simple reason, my dear Mr. Mac, that you have not got the\r\nfirst idea what it is that you are investigating.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are investigating the murder of Mr. John Douglas of Birlstone\r\nManor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, so you are. But don\u2019t trouble to trace the mysterious\r\ngentleman upon the bicycle. I assure you that it won\u2019t help you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what do you suggest that we do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will tell you exactly what to do, if you will do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m bound to say I\u2019ve always found you had reason behind all\r\nyour queer ways. I\u2019ll do what you advise.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you, Mr. White Mason?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe country detective looked helplessly from one to the other. Holmes\r\nand his methods were new to him. \u201cWell, if it is good enough for the\r\ninspector, it is good enough for me,\u201d he said at last.\r\n\r\n\u201cCapital!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWell, then, I should recommend a nice, cheery\r\ncountry walk for both of you. They tell me that the views from\r\nBirlstone Ridge over the Weald are very remarkable. No doubt lunch\r\ncould be got at some suitable hostelry; though my ignorance of the\r\ncountry prevents me from recommending one. In the evening, tired but\r\nhappy\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMan, this is getting past a joke!\u201d cried MacDonald, rising angrily\r\nfrom his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well, spend the day as you like,\u201d said Holmes, patting him\r\ncheerfully upon the shoulder. \u201cDo what you like and go where you will,\r\nbut meet me here before dusk without fail\u2014without fail, Mr. Mac.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat sounds more like sanity.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll of it was excellent advice; but I don\u2019t insist, so long as you are\r\nhere when I need you. But now, before we part, I want you to write a\r\nnote to Mr. Barker.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll dictate it, if you like. Ready?\r\n\r\n\u201cDEAR SIR.\u2014It has struck me that it is our duty to drain the moat, in\r\nthe hope that we may find some\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cI\u2019ve made inquiry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTut, tut! My dear sir, please do what I ask you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, go on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014in the hope that we may find something which may bear upon our\r\ninvestigation. I have made arrangements, and the workmen will be at\r\nwork early to-morrow morning diverting the stream\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014diverting the stream; so I thought it best to explain matters\r\nbeforehand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNow sign that, and send it by hand about four o\u2019clock. At that hour we\r\nshall meet again in this room. Until then we may each do what we like;\r\nfor I can assure you that this inquiry has come to a definite pause.\u201d\r\n\r\nEvening was drawing in when we reassembled. Holmes was very serious in\r\nhis manner, myself curious, and the detectives obviously critical and\r\nannoyed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, gentlemen,\u201d said my friend gravely, \u201cI am asking you now to put\r\neverything to the test with me, and you will judge for yourselves\r\nwhether the observations I have made justify the conclusions to which I\r\nhave come. It is a chill evening, and I do not know how long our\r\nexpedition may last; so I beg that you will wear your warmest coats. It\r\nis of the first importance that we should be in our places before it\r\ngrows dark; so with your permission we shall get started at once.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe passed along the outer bounds of the Manor House park until we came\r\nto a place where there was a gap in the rails which fenced it. Through\r\nthis we slipped, and then in the gathering gloom we followed Holmes\r\nuntil we had reached a shrubbery which lies nearly opposite to the main\r\ndoor and the drawbridge. The latter had not been raised. Holmes\r\ncrouched down behind the screen of laurels, and we all three followed\r\nhis example.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what are we to do now?\u201d asked MacDonald with some gruffness.\r\n\r\n\u201cPossess our souls in patience and make as little noise as possible,\u201d\r\nHolmes answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are we here for at all? I really think that you might treat us\r\nwith more frankness.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed. \u201cWatson insists that I am the dramatist in real life,\u201d\r\nsaid he. \u201cSome touch of the artist wells up within me, and calls\r\ninsistently for a well-staged performance. Surely our profession, Mr.\r\nMac, would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the\r\nscene so as to glorify our results. The blunt accusation, the brutal\r\ntap upon the shoulder\u2014what can one make of such a denouement? But the\r\nquick inference, the subtle trap, the clever forecast of coming events,\r\nthe triumphant vindication of bold theories\u2014are these not the pride and\r\nthe justification of our life\u2019s work? At the present moment you thrill\r\nwith the glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the hunt.\r\nWhere would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable? I\r\nonly ask a little patience, Mr. Mac, and all will be clear to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I hope the pride and justification and the rest of it will come\r\nbefore we all get our death of cold,\u201d said the London detective with\r\ncomic resignation.\r\n\r\nWe all had good reason to join in the aspiration; for our vigil was a\r\nlong and bitter one. Slowly the shadows darkened over the long, sombre\r\nface of the old house. A cold, damp reek from the moat chilled us to\r\nthe bones and set our teeth chattering. There was a single lamp over\r\nthe gateway and a steady globe of light in the fatal study. Everything\r\nelse was dark and still.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long is this to last?\u201d asked the inspector finally. \u201cAnd what is\r\nit we are watching for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no more notion than you how long it is to last,\u201d Holmes\r\nanswered with some asperity. \u201cIf criminals would always schedule their\r\nmovements like railway trains, it would certainly be more convenient\r\nfor all of us. As to what it is we\u2014 Well, _that\u2019s_ what we are watching\r\nfor!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the bright, yellow light in the study was obscured by\r\nsomebody passing to and fro before it. The laurels among which we lay\r\nwere immediately opposite the window and not more than a hundred feet\r\nfrom it. Presently it was thrown open with a whining of hinges, and we\r\ncould dimly see the dark outline of a man\u2019s head and shoulders looking\r\nout into the gloom. For some minutes he peered forth in furtive,\r\nstealthy fashion, as one who wishes to be assured that he is\r\nunobserved. Then he leaned forward, and in the intense silence we were\r\naware of the soft lapping of agitated water. He seemed to be stirring\r\nup the moat with something which he held in his hand. Then suddenly he\r\nhauled something in as a fisherman lands a fish\u2014some large, round\r\nobject which obscured the light as it was dragged through the open\r\ncasement.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow!\u201d cried Holmes. \u201cNow!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were all upon our feet, staggering after him with our stiffened\r\nlimbs, while he ran swiftly across the bridge and rang violently at the\r\nbell. There was the rasping of bolts from the other side, and the\r\namazed Ames stood in the entrance. Holmes brushed him aside without a\r\nword and, followed by all of us, rushed into the room which had been\r\noccupied by the man whom we had been watching.\r\n\r\nThe oil lamp on the table represented the glow which we had seen from\r\noutside. It was now in the hand of Cecil Barker, who held it towards us\r\nas we entered. Its light shone upon his strong, resolute, clean-shaved\r\nface and his menacing eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the devil is the meaning of all this?\u201d he cried. \u201cWhat are you\r\nafter, anyhow?\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes took a swift glance round, and then pounced upon a sodden bundle\r\ntied together with cord which lay where it had been thrust under the\r\nwriting table.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is what we are after, Mr. Barker\u2014this bundle, weighted with a\r\ndumb-bell, which you have just raised from the bottom of the moat.\u201d\r\n\r\nBarker stared at Holmes with amazement in his face. \u201cHow in thunder\r\ncame you to know anything about it?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cSimply that I put it there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou put it there! You!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I should have said \u2018replaced it there,\u2019\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYou\r\nwill remember, Inspector MacDonald, that I was somewhat struck by the\r\nabsence of a dumb-bell. I drew your attention to it; but with the\r\npressure of other events you had hardly the time to give it the\r\nconsideration which would have enabled you to draw deductions from it.\r\nWhen water is near and a weight is missing it is not a very far-fetched\r\nsupposition that something has been sunk in the water. The idea was at\r\nleast worth testing; so with the help of Ames, who admitted me to the\r\nroom, and the crook of Dr. Watson\u2019s umbrella, I was able last night to\r\nfish up and inspect this bundle.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was of the first importance, however, that we should be able to\r\nprove who placed it there. This we accomplished by the very obvious\r\ndevice of announcing that the moat would be dried to-morrow, which had,\r\nof course, the effect that whoever had hidden the bundle would most\r\ncertainly withdraw it the moment that darkness enabled him to do so. We\r\nhave no less than four witnesses as to who it was who took advantage of\r\nthe opportunity, and so, Mr. Barker, I think the word lies now with\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes put the sopping bundle upon the table beside the lamp\r\nand undid the cord which bound it. From within he extracted a\r\ndumb-bell, which he tossed down to its fellow in the corner. Next he\r\ndrew forth a pair of boots. \u201cAmerican, as you perceive,\u201d he remarked,\r\npointing to the toes. Then he laid upon the table a long, deadly,\r\nsheathed knife. Finally he unravelled a bundle of clothing, comprising\r\na complete set of underclothes, socks, a gray tweed suit, and a short\r\nyellow overcoat.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe clothes are commonplace,\u201d remarked Holmes, \u201csave only the\r\novercoat, which is full of suggestive touches.\u201d He held it tenderly\r\ntowards the light. \u201cHere, as you perceive, is the inner pocket\r\nprolonged into the lining in such fashion as to give ample space for\r\nthe truncated fowling piece. The tailor\u2019s tab is on the neck\u2014\u2018Neal,\r\nOutfitter, Vermissa, U.S.A.\u2019 I have spent an instructive afternoon in\r\nthe rector\u2019s library, and have enlarged my knowledge by adding the fact\r\nthat Vermissa is a flourishing little town at the head of one of the\r\nbest known coal and iron valleys in the United States. I have some\r\nrecollection, Mr. Barker, that you associated the coal districts with\r\nMr. Douglas\u2019s first wife, and it would surely not be too far-fetched an\r\ninference that the V.V. upon the card by the dead body might stand for\r\nVermissa Valley, or that this very valley which sends forth emissaries\r\nof murder may be that Valley of Fear of which we have heard. So much is\r\nfairly clear. And now, Mr. Barker, I seem to be standing rather in the\r\nway of your explanation.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a sight to see Cecil Barker\u2019s expressive face during this\r\nexposition of the great detective. Anger, amazement, consternation, and\r\nindecision swept over it in turn. Finally he took refuge in a somewhat\r\nacrid irony.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know such a lot, Mr. Holmes, perhaps you had better tell us some\r\nmore,\u201d he sneered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no doubt that I could tell you a great deal more, Mr. Barker;\r\nbut it would come with a better grace from you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you think so, do you? Well, all I can say is that if there\u2019s any\r\nsecret here it is not my secret, and I am not the man to give it away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if you take that line, Mr. Barker,\u201d said the inspector quietly,\r\n\u201cwe must just keep you in sight until we have the warrant and can hold\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can do what you damn please about that,\u201d said Barker defiantly.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings seemed to have come to a definite end so far as he was\r\nconcerned; for one had only to look at that granite face to realize\r\nthat no \u2018_peine forte et dure_\u2019 would ever force him to plead against\r\nhis will. The deadlock was broken, however, by a woman\u2019s voice. Mrs.\r\nDouglas had been standing listening at the half opened door, and now\r\nshe entered the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have done enough for now, Cecil,\u201d said she. \u201cWhatever comes of it\r\nin the future, you have done enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEnough and more than enough,\u201d remarked Sherlock Holmes gravely. \u201cI\r\nhave every sympathy with you, madam, and should strongly urge you to\r\nhave some confidence in the common sense of our jurisdiction and to\r\ntake the police voluntarily into your complete confidence. It may be\r\nthat I am myself at fault for not following up the hint which you\r\nconveyed to me through my friend, Dr. Watson; but, at that time I had\r\nevery reason to believe that you were directly concerned in the crime.\r\nNow I am assured that this is not so. At the same time, there is much\r\nthat is unexplained, and I should strongly recommend that you ask Mr.\r\nDouglas to tell us his own story.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Douglas gave a cry of astonishment at Holmes\u2019s words. The\r\ndetectives and I must have echoed it, when we were aware of a man who\r\nseemed to have emerged from the wall, who advanced now from the gloom\r\nof the corner in which he had appeared. Mrs. Douglas turned, and in an\r\ninstant her arms were round him. Barker had seized his outstretched\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s best this way, Jack,\u201d his wife repeated; \u201cI am sure that it is\r\nbest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, yes, Mr. Douglas,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, \u201cI am sure that you\r\nwill find it best.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man stood blinking at us with the dazed look of one who comes from\r\nthe dark into the light. It was a remarkable face, bold gray eyes, a\r\nstrong, short-clipped, grizzled moustache, a square, projecting chin,\r\nand a humorous mouth. He took a good look at us all, and then to my\r\namazement he advanced to me and handed me a bundle of paper.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of you,\u201d said he in a voice which was not quite English and\r\nnot quite American, but was altogether mellow and pleasing. \u201cYou are\r\nthe historian of this bunch. Well, Dr. Watson, you\u2019ve never had such a\r\nstory as that pass through your hands before, and I\u2019ll lay my last\r\ndollar on that. Tell it your own way; but there are the facts, and you\r\ncan\u2019t miss the public so long as you have those. I\u2019ve been cooped up\r\ntwo days, and I\u2019ve spent the daylight hours\u2014as much daylight as I could\r\nget in that rat trap\u2014in putting the thing into words. You\u2019re welcome to\r\nthem\u2014you and your public. There\u2019s the story of the Valley of Fear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the past, Mr. Douglas,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes quietly. \u201cWhat we\r\ndesire now is to hear your story of the present.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have it, sir,\u201d said Douglas. \u201cMay I smoke as I talk? Well,\r\nthank you, Mr. Holmes. You\u2019re a smoker yourself, if I remember right,\r\nand you\u2019ll guess what it is to be sitting for two days with tobacco in\r\nyour pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away.\u201d He leaned\r\nagainst the mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which Holmes had handed\r\nhim. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I never guessed that I should meet\r\nyou. But before you are through with that,\u201d he nodded at my papers,\r\n\u201cyou will say I\u2019ve brought you something fresh.\u201d\r\n\r\nInspector MacDonald had been staring at the newcomer with the greatest\r\namazement. \u201cWell, this fairly beats me!\u201d he cried at last. \u201cIf you are\r\nMr. John Douglas of Birlstone Manor, then whose death have we been\r\ninvestigating for these two days, and where in the world have you\r\nsprung from now? You seemed to me to come out of the floor like a\r\njack-in-a-box.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, Mr. Mac,\u201d said Holmes, shaking a reproving forefinger, \u201cyou would\r\nnot read that excellent local compilation which described the\r\nconcealment of King Charles. People did not hide in those days without\r\nexcellent hiding places, and the hiding place that has once been used\r\nmay be again. I had persuaded myself that we should find Mr. Douglas\r\nunder this roof.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how long have you been playing this trick upon us, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\nsaid the inspector angrily. \u201cHow long have you allowed us to waste\r\nourselves upon a search that you knew to be an absurd one?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot one instant, my dear Mr. Mac. Only last night did I form my views\r\nof the case. As they could not be put to the proof until this evening,\r\nI invited you and your colleague to take a holiday for the day. Pray\r\nwhat more could I do? When I found the suit of clothes in the moat, it\r\nat once became apparent to me that the body we had found could not have\r\nbeen the body of Mr. John Douglas at all, but must be that of the\r\nbicyclist from Tunbridge Wells. No other conclusion was possible.\r\nTherefore I had to determine where Mr. John Douglas himself could be,\r\nand the balance of probability was that with the connivance of his wife\r\nand his friend he was concealed in a house which had such conveniences\r\nfor a fugitive, and awaiting quieter times when he could make his final\r\nescape.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you figured it out about right,\u201d said Douglas approvingly. \u201cI\r\nthought I\u2019d dodge your British law; for I was not sure how I stood\r\nunder it, and also I saw my chance to throw these hounds once for all\r\noff my track. Mind you, from first to last I have done nothing to be\r\nashamed of, and nothing that I would not do again; but you\u2019ll judge\r\nthat for yourselves when I tell you my story. Never mind warning me,\r\nInspector: I\u2019m ready to stand pat upon the truth.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to begin at the beginning. That\u2019s all there,\u201d he\r\nindicated my bundle of papers, \u201cand a mighty queer yarn you\u2019ll find it.\r\nIt all comes down to this: That there are some men that have good cause\r\nto hate me and would give their last dollar to know that they had got\r\nme. So long as I am alive and they are alive, there is no safety in\r\nthis world for me. They hunted me from Chicago to California, then they\r\nchased me out of America; but when I married and settled down in this\r\nquiet spot I thought my last years were going to be peaceable.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never explained to my wife how things were. Why should I pull her\r\ninto it? She would never have a quiet moment again; but would always be\r\nimagining trouble. I fancy she knew something, for I may have dropped a\r\nword here or a word there; but until yesterday, after you gentlemen had\r\nseen her, she never knew the rights of the matter. She told you all she\r\nknew, and so did Barker here; for on the night when this thing happened\r\nthere was mighty little time for explanations. She knows everything\r\nnow, and I would have been a wiser man if I had told her sooner. But it\r\nwas a hard question, dear,\u201d he took her hand for an instant in his own,\r\n\u201cand I acted for the best.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, gentlemen, the day before these happenings I was over in\r\nTunbridge Wells, and I got a glimpse of a man in the street. It was\r\nonly a glimpse; but I have a quick eye for these things, and I never\r\ndoubted who it was. It was the worst enemy I had among them all\u2014one who\r\nhas been after me like a hungry wolf after a caribou all these years. I\r\nknew there was trouble coming, and I came home and made ready for it. I\r\nguessed I\u2019d fight through it all right on my own, my luck was a proverb\r\nin the States about \u201976. I never doubted that it would be with me\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was on my guard all that next day, and never went out into the park.\r\nIt\u2019s as well, or he\u2019d have had the drop on me with that buckshot gun of\r\nhis before ever I could draw on him. After the bridge was up\u2014my mind\r\nwas always more restful when that bridge was up in the evenings\u2014I put\r\nthe thing clear out of my head. I never dreamed of his getting into the\r\nhouse and waiting for me. But when I made my round in my dressing gown,\r\nas was my habit, I had no sooner entered the study than I scented\r\ndanger. I guess when a man has had dangers in his life\u2014and I\u2019ve had\r\nmore than most in my time\u2014there is a kind of sixth sense that waves the\r\nred flag. I saw the signal clear enough, and yet I couldn\u2019t tell you\r\nwhy. Next instant I spotted a boot under the window curtain, and then I\r\nsaw why plain enough.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d just the one candle that was in my hand; but there was a good\r\nlight from the hall lamp through the open door. I put down the candle\r\nand jumped for a hammer that I\u2019d left on the mantel. At the same moment\r\nhe sprang at me. I saw the glint of a knife, and I lashed at him with\r\nthe hammer. I got him somewhere; for the knife tinkled down on the\r\nfloor. He dodged round the table as quick as an eel, and a moment later\r\nhe\u2019d got his gun from under his coat. I heard him cock it; but I had\r\ngot hold of it before he could fire. I had it by the barrel, and we\r\nwrestled for it all ends up for a minute or more. It was death to the\r\nman that lost his grip.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe never lost his grip; but he got it butt downward for a moment too\r\nlong. Maybe it was I that pulled the trigger. Maybe we just jolted it\r\noff between us. Anyhow, he got both barrels in the face, and there I\r\nwas, staring down at all that was left of Ted Baldwin. I\u2019d recognized\r\nhim in the township, and again when he sprang for me; but his own\r\nmother wouldn\u2019t recognize him as I saw him then. I\u2019m used to rough\r\nwork; but I fairly turned sick at the sight of him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was hanging on the side of the table when Barker came hurrying down.\r\nI heard my wife coming, and I ran to the door and stopped her. It was\r\nno sight for a woman. I promised I\u2019d come to her soon. I said a word or\r\ntwo to Barker\u2014he took it all in at a glance\u2014and we waited for the rest\r\nto come along. But there was no sign of them. Then we understood that\r\nthey could hear nothing, and that all that had happened was known only\r\nto ourselves.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was at that instant that the idea came to me. I was fairly dazzled\r\nby the brilliance of it. The man\u2019s sleeve had slipped up and there was\r\nthe branded mark of the lodge upon his forearm. See here!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man whom we had known as Douglas turned up his own coat and cuff to\r\nshow a brown triangle within a circle exactly like that which we had\r\nseen upon the dead man.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was the sight of that which started me on it. I seemed to see it\r\nall clear at a glance. There were his height and hair and figure, about\r\nthe same as my own. No one could swear to his face, poor devil! I\r\nbrought down this suit of clothes, and in a quarter of an hour Barker\r\nand I had put my dressing gown on him and he lay as you found him. We\r\ntied all his things into a bundle, and I weighted them with the only\r\nweight I could find and put them through the window. The card he had\r\nmeant to lay upon my body was lying beside his own.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy rings were put on his finger; but when it came to the wedding\r\nring,\u201d he held out his muscular hand, \u201cyou can see for yourselves that\r\nI had struck the limit. I have not moved it since the day I was\r\nmarried, and it would have taken a file to get it off. I don\u2019t know,\r\nanyhow, that I should have cared to part with it; but if I had wanted\r\nto I couldn\u2019t. So we just had to leave that detail to take care of\r\nitself. On the other hand, I brought a bit of plaster down and put it\r\nwhere I am wearing one myself at this instant. You slipped up there,\r\nMr. Holmes, clever as you are; for if you had chanced to take off that\r\nplaster you would have found no cut underneath it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that was the situation. If I could lie low for a while and then\r\nget away where I could be joined by my \u2018widow\u2019 we should have a chance\r\nat last of living in peace for the rest of our lives. These devils\r\nwould give me no rest so long as I was above ground; but if they saw in\r\nthe papers that Baldwin had got his man, there would be an end of all\r\nmy troubles. I hadn\u2019t much time to make it all clear to Barker and to\r\nmy wife; but they understood enough to be able to help me. I knew all\r\nabout this hiding place, so did Ames; but it never entered his head to\r\nconnect it with the matter. I retired into it, and it was up to Barker\r\nto do the rest.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess you can fill in for yourselves what he did. He opened the\r\nwindow and made the mark on the sill to give an idea of how the\r\nmurderer escaped. It was a tall order, that; but as the bridge was up\r\nthere was no other way. Then, when everything was fixed, he rang the\r\nbell for all he was worth. What happened afterward you know. And so,\r\ngentlemen, you can do what you please; but I\u2019ve told you the truth and\r\nthe whole truth, so help me God! What I ask you now is how do I stand\r\nby the English law?\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a silence which was broken by Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe English law is in the main a just law. You will get no worse than\r\nyour deserts from that, Mr. Douglas. But I would ask you how did this\r\nman know that you lived here, or how to get into your house, or where\r\nto hide to get you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know nothing of this.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes\u2019s face was very white and grave. \u201cThe story is not over yet, I\r\nfear,\u201d said he. \u201cYou may find worse dangers than the English law, or\r\neven than your enemies from America. I see trouble before you, Mr.\r\nDouglas. You\u2019ll take my advice and still be on your guard.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd now, my long-suffering readers, I will ask you to come away with me\r\nfor a time, far from the Sussex Manor House of Birlstone, and far also\r\nfrom the year of grace in which we made our eventful journey which\r\nended with the strange story of the man who had been known as John\r\nDouglas. I wish you to journey back some twenty years in time, and\r\nwestward some thousands of miles in space, that I may lay before you a\r\nsingular and terrible narrative\u2014so singular and so terrible that you\r\nmay find it hard to believe that even as I tell it, even so did it\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nDo not think that I intrude one story before another is finished. As\r\nyou read on you will find that this is not so. And when I have detailed\r\nthose distant events and you have solved this mystery of the past, we\r\nshall meet once more in those rooms on Baker Street, where this, like\r\nso many other wonderful happenings, will find its end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\nThe Scowrers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I\r\nThe Man\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the fourth of February in the year 1875. It had been a severe\r\nwinter, and the snow lay deep in the gorges of the Gilmerton Mountains.\r\nThe steam ploughs had, however, kept the railroad open, and the evening\r\ntrain which connects the long line of coal-mining and iron-working\r\nsettlements was slowly groaning its way up the steep gradients which\r\nlead from Stagville on the plain to Vermissa, the central township\r\nwhich lies at the head of Vermissa Valley. From this point the track\r\nsweeps downward to Bartons Crossing, Helmdale, and the purely\r\nagricultural county of Merton. It was a single track railroad; but at\r\nevery siding\u2014and they were numerous\u2014long lines of trucks piled with\r\ncoal and iron ore told of the hidden wealth which had brought a rude\r\npopulation and a bustling life to this most desolate corner of the\r\nUnited States of America.\r\n\r\nFor desolate it was! Little could the first pioneer who had traversed\r\nit have ever imagined that the fairest prairies and the most lush water\r\npastures were valueless compared to this gloomy land of black crag and\r\ntangled forest. Above the dark and often scarcely penetrable woods upon\r\ntheir flanks, the high, bare crowns of the mountains, white snow, and\r\njagged rock towered upon each flank, leaving a long, winding, tortuous\r\nvalley in the centre. Up this the little train was slowly crawling.\r\n\r\nThe oil lamps had just been lit in the leading passenger car, a long,\r\nbare carriage in which some twenty or thirty people were seated. The\r\ngreater number of these were workmen returning from their day\u2019s toil in\r\nthe lower part of the valley. At least a dozen, by their grimed faces\r\nand the safety lanterns which they carried, proclaimed themselves\r\nminers. These sat smoking in a group and conversed in low voices,\r\nglancing occasionally at two men on the opposite side of the car, whose\r\nuniforms and badges showed them to be policemen.\r\n\r\nSeveral women of the labouring class and one or two travellers who\r\nmight have been small local storekeepers made up the rest of the\r\ncompany, with the exception of one young man in a corner by himself. It\r\nis with this man that we are concerned. Take a good look at him; for he\r\nis worth it.\r\n\r\nHe is a fresh-complexioned, middle-sized young man, not far, one would\r\nguess, from his thirtieth year. He has large, shrewd, humorous gray\r\neyes which twinkle inquiringly from time to time as he looks round\r\nthrough his spectacles at the people about him. It is easy to see that\r\nhe is of a sociable and possibly simple disposition, anxious to be\r\nfriendly to all men. Anyone could pick him at once as gregarious in his\r\nhabits and communicative in his nature, with a quick wit and a ready\r\nsmile. And yet the man who studied him more closely might discern a\r\ncertain firmness of jaw and grim tightness about the lips which would\r\nwarn him that there were depths beyond, and that this pleasant,\r\nbrown-haired young Irishman might conceivably leave his mark for good\r\nor evil upon any society to which he was introduced.\r\n\r\nHaving made one or two tentative remarks to the nearest miner, and\r\nreceiving only short, gruff replies, the traveller resigned himself to\r\nuncongenial silence, staring moodily out of the window at the fading\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\nIt was not a cheering prospect. Through the growing gloom there pulsed\r\nthe red glow of the furnaces on the sides of the hills. Great heaps of\r\nslag and dumps of cinders loomed up on each side, with the high shafts\r\nof the collieries towering above them. Huddled groups of mean, wooden\r\nhouses, the windows of which were beginning to outline themselves in\r\nlight, were scattered here and there along the line, and the frequent\r\nhalting places were crowded with their swarthy inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe iron and coal valleys of the Vermissa district were no resorts for\r\nthe leisured or the cultured. Everywhere there were stern signs of the\r\ncrudest battle of life, the rude work to be done, and the rude, strong\r\nworkers who did it.\r\n\r\nThe young traveller gazed out into this dismal country with a face of\r\nmingled repulsion and interest, which showed that the scene was new to\r\nhim. At intervals he drew from his pocket a bulky letter to which he\r\nreferred, and on the margins of which he scribbled some notes. Once\r\nfrom the back of his waist he produced something which one would hardly\r\nhave expected to find in the possession of so mild-mannered a man. It\r\nwas a navy revolver of the largest size. As he turned it slantwise to\r\nthe light, the glint upon the rims of the copper shells within the drum\r\nshowed that it was fully loaded. He quickly restored it to his secret\r\npocket, but not before it had been observed by a working man who had\r\nseated himself upon the adjoining bench.\r\n\r\n\u201cHullo, mate!\u201d said he. \u201cYou seem heeled and ready.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young man smiled with an air of embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said he, \u201cwe need them sometimes in the place I come from.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd where may that be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m last from Chicago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA stranger in these parts?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may find you need it here,\u201d said the workman.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! is that so?\u201d The young man seemed interested.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you heard nothing of doings hereabouts?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing out of the way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I thought the country was full of it. You\u2019ll hear quick enough.\r\nWhat made you come here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI heard there was always work for a willing man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you a member of the union?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll get your job, I guess. Have you any friends?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot yet; but I have the means of making them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s that, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am one of the Eminent Order of Freemen. There\u2019s no town without a\r\nlodge, and where there is a lodge I\u2019ll find my friends.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe remark had a singular effect upon his companion. He glanced round\r\nsuspiciously at the others in the car. The miners were still whispering\r\namong themselves. The two police officers were dozing. He came across,\r\nseated himself close to the young traveller, and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cPut it there,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nA hand-grip passed between the two.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see you speak the truth,\u201d said the workman. \u201cBut it\u2019s well to make\r\ncertain.\u201d He raised his right hand to his right eyebrow. The traveller\r\nat once raised his left hand to his left eyebrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cDark nights are unpleasant,\u201d said the workman.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, for strangers to travel,\u201d the other answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good enough. I\u2019m Brother Scanlan, Lodge 341, Vermissa Valley.\r\nGlad to see you in these parts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I\u2019m Brother John McMurdo, Lodge 29, Chicago. Bodymaster\r\nJ.H. Scott. But I am in luck to meet a brother so early.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there are plenty of us about. You won\u2019t find the order more\r\nflourishing anywhere in the States than right here in Vermissa Valley.\r\nBut we could do with some lads like you. I can\u2019t understand a spry man\r\nof the union finding no work to do in Chicago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI found plenty of work to do,\u201d said McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why did you leave?\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo nodded towards the policemen and smiled. \u201cI guess those chaps\r\nwould be glad to know,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nScanlan groaned sympathetically. \u201cIn trouble?\u201d he asked in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201cDeep.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA penitentiary job?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the rest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a killing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s early days to talk of such things,\u201d said McMurdo with the air of\r\na man who had been surprised into saying more than he intended. \u201cI\u2019ve\r\nmy own good reasons for leaving Chicago, and let that be enough for\r\nyou. Who are you that you should take it on yourself to ask such\r\nthings?\u201d His gray eyes gleamed with sudden and dangerous anger from\r\nbehind his glasses.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, mate, no offense meant. The boys will think none the worse\r\nof you, whatever you may have done. Where are you bound for now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVermissa.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the third halt down the line. Where are you staying?\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo took out an envelope and held it close to the murky oil lamp.\r\n\u201cHere is the address\u2014Jacob Shafter, Sheridan Street. It\u2019s a boarding\r\nhouse that was recommended by a man I knew in Chicago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know it; but Vermissa is out of my beat. I live at\r\nHobson\u2019s Patch, and that\u2019s here where we are drawing up. But, say,\r\nthere\u2019s one bit of advice I\u2019ll give you before we part: If you\u2019re in\r\ntrouble in Vermissa, go straight to the Union House and see Boss\r\nMcGinty. He is the Bodymaster of Vermissa Lodge, and nothing can happen\r\nin these parts unless Black Jack McGinty wants it. So long, mate! Maybe\r\nwe\u2019ll meet in lodge one of these evenings. But mind my words: If you\r\nare in trouble, go to Boss McGinty.\u201d\r\n\r\nScanlan descended, and McMurdo was left once again to his thoughts.\r\nNight had now fallen, and the flames of the frequent furnaces were\r\nroaring and leaping in the darkness. Against their lurid background\r\ndark figures were bending and straining, twisting and turning, with the\r\nmotion of winch or of windlass, to the rhythm of an eternal clank and\r\nroar.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess hell must look something like that,\u201d said a voice.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo turned and saw that one of the policemen had shifted in his\r\nseat and was staring out into the fiery waste.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor that matter,\u201d said the other policeman, \u201cI allow that hell must\r\n_be_ something like that. If there are worse devils down yonder than\r\nsome we could name, it\u2019s more than I\u2019d expect. I guess you are new to\r\nthis part, young man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what if I am?\u201d McMurdo answered in a surly voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust this, mister, that I should advise you to be careful in choosing\r\nyour friends. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d begin with Mike Scanlan or his gang if\r\nI were you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is it to you who are my friends?\u201d roared McMurdo in a\r\nvoice which brought every head in the carriage round to witness the\r\naltercation. \u201cDid I ask you for your advice, or did you think me such a\r\nsucker that I couldn\u2019t move without it? You speak when you are spoken\r\nto, and by the Lord you\u2019d have to wait a long time if it was me!\u201d He\r\nthrust out his face and grinned at the patrolmen like a snarling dog.\r\n\r\nThe two policemen, heavy, good-natured men, were taken aback by the\r\nextraordinary vehemence with which their friendly advances had been\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo offense, stranger,\u201d said one. \u201cIt was a warning for your own good,\r\nseeing that you are, by your own showing, new to the place.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m new to the place; but I\u2019m not new to you and your kind!\u201d cried\r\nMcMurdo in cold fury. \u201cI guess you\u2019re the same in all places, shoving\r\nyour advice in when nobody asks for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll see more of you before very long,\u201d said one of the\r\npatrolmen with a grin. \u201cYou\u2019re a real hand-picked one, if I am a\r\njudge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was thinking the same,\u201d remarked the other. \u201cI guess we may meet\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you, and don\u2019t you think it!\u201d cried McMurdo. \u201cMy\r\nname\u2019s Jack McMurdo\u2014see? If you want me, you\u2019ll find me at Jacob\r\nShafter\u2019s on Sheridan Street, Vermissa; so I\u2019m not hiding from you, am\r\nI? Day or night I dare to look the like of you in the face\u2014don\u2019t make\r\nany mistake about that!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of sympathy and admiration from the miners at the\r\ndauntless demeanour of the newcomer, while the two policemen shrugged\r\ntheir shoulders and renewed a conversation between themselves.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the train ran into the ill-lit station, and there\r\nwas a general clearing; for Vermissa was by far the largest town on the\r\nline. McMurdo picked up his leather gripsack and was about to start off\r\ninto the darkness, when one of the miners accosted him.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy Gar, mate! you know how to speak to the cops,\u201d he said in a voice\r\nof awe. \u201cIt was grand to hear you. Let me carry your grip and show you\r\nthe road. I\u2019m passing Shafter\u2019s on the way to my own shack.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a chorus of friendly \u201cGood-nights\u201d from the other miners as\r\nthey passed from the platform. Before ever he had set foot in it,\r\nMcMurdo the turbulent had become a character in Vermissa.\r\n\r\nThe country had been a place of terror; but the town was in its way\r\neven more depressing. Down that long valley there was at least a\r\ncertain gloomy grandeur in the huge fires and the clouds of drifting\r\nsmoke, while the strength and industry of man found fitting monuments\r\nin the hills which he had spilled by the side of his monstrous\r\nexcavations. But the town showed a dead level of mean ugliness and\r\nsqualor. The broad street was churned up by the traffic into a horrible\r\nrutted paste of muddy snow. The sidewalks were narrow and uneven. The\r\nnumerous gas-lamps served only to show more clearly a long line of\r\nwooden houses, each with its veranda facing the street, unkempt and\r\ndirty.\r\n\r\nAs they approached the centre of the town the scene was brightened by a\r\nrow of well-lit stores, and even more by a cluster of saloons and\r\ngaming houses, in which the miners spent their hard-earned but generous\r\nwages.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the Union House,\u201d said the guide, pointing to one saloon which\r\nrose almost to the dignity of being a hotel. \u201cJack McGinty is the boss\r\nthere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat sort of a man is he?\u201d McMurdo asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! have you never heard of the boss?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow could I have heard of him when you know that I am a stranger in\r\nthese parts?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I thought his name was known clear across the country. It\u2019s been\r\nin the papers often enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d the miner lowered his voice\u2014\u201cover the affairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat affairs?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood Lord, mister! you are queer, if I must say it without offense.\r\nThere\u2019s only one set of affairs that you\u2019ll hear of in these parts, and\r\nthat\u2019s the affairs of the Scowrers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I seem to have read of the Scowrers in Chicago. A gang of\r\nmurderers, are they not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush, on your life!\u201d cried the miner, standing still in alarm, and\r\ngazing in amazement at his companion. \u201cMan, you won\u2019t live long in\r\nthese parts if you speak in the open street like that. Many a man has\r\nhad the life beaten out of him for less.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I know nothing about them. It\u2019s only what I have read.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m not saying that you have not read the truth.\u201d The man looked\r\nnervously round him as he spoke, peering into the shadows as if he\r\nfeared to see some lurking danger. \u201cIf killing is murder, then God\r\nknows there is murder and to spare. But don\u2019t you dare to breathe the\r\nname of Jack McGinty in connection with it, stranger; for every whisper\r\ngoes back to him, and he is not one that is likely to let it pass. Now,\r\nthat\u2019s the house you\u2019re after, that one standing back from the street.\r\nYou\u2019ll find old Jacob Shafter that runs it as honest a man as lives in\r\nthis township.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank you,\u201d said McMurdo, and shaking hands with his new\r\nacquaintance he plodded, gripsack in hand, up the path which led to the\r\ndwelling house, at the door of which he gave a resounding knock.\r\n\r\nIt was opened at once by someone very different from what he had\r\nexpected. It was a woman, young and singularly beautiful. She was of\r\nthe German type, blonde and fair-haired, with the piquant contrast of a\r\npair of beautiful dark eyes with which she surveyed the stranger with\r\nsurprise and a pleasing embarrassment which brought a wave of colour\r\nover her pale face. Framed in the bright light of the open doorway, it\r\nseemed to McMurdo that he had never seen a more beautiful picture; the\r\nmore attractive for its contrast with the sordid and gloomy\r\nsurroundings. A lovely violet growing upon one of those black\r\nslag-heaps of the mines would not have seemed more surprising. So\r\nentranced was he that he stood staring without a word, and it was she\r\nwho broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought it was father,\u201d said she with a pleasing little touch of a\r\nGerman accent. \u201cDid you come to see him? He is down town. I expect him\r\nback every minute.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo continued to gaze at her in open admiration until her eyes\r\ndropped in confusion before this masterful visitor.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, miss,\u201d he said at last, \u201cI\u2019m in no hurry to see him. But your\r\nhouse was recommended to me for board. I thought it might suit me\u2014and\r\nnow I know it will.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are quick to make up your mind,\u201d said she with a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnyone but a blind man could do as much,\u201d the other answered.\r\n\r\nShe laughed at the compliment. \u201cCome right in, sir,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m\r\nMiss Ettie Shafter, Mr. Shafter\u2019s daughter. My mother\u2019s dead, and I run\r\nthe house. You can sit down by the stove in the front room until father\r\ncomes along\u2014Ah, here he is! So you can fix things with him right away.\u201d\r\n\r\nA heavy, elderly man came plodding up the path. In a few words McMurdo\r\nexplained his business. A man of the name of Murphy had given him the\r\naddress in Chicago. He in turn had had it from someone else. Old\r\nShafter was quite ready. The stranger made no bones about terms, agreed\r\nat once to every condition, and was apparently fairly flush of money.\r\nFor seven dollars a week paid in advance he was to have board and\r\nlodging.\r\n\r\nSo it was that McMurdo, the self-confessed fugitive from justice, took\r\nup his abode under the roof of the Shafters, the first step which was\r\nto lead to so long and dark a train of events, ending in a far distant\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\nThe Bodymaster\r\n\r\n\r\nMcMurdo was a man who made his mark quickly. Wherever he was the folk\r\naround soon knew it. Within a week he had become infinitely the most\r\nimportant person at Shafter\u2019s. There were ten or a dozen boarders\r\nthere; but they were honest foremen or commonplace clerks from the\r\nstores, of a very different calibre from the young Irishman. Of an\r\nevening when they gathered together his joke was always the readiest,\r\nhis conversation the brightest, and his song the best. He was a born\r\nboon companion, with a magnetism which drew good humour from all around\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he showed again and again, as he had shown in the railway\r\ncarriage, a capacity for sudden, fierce anger, which compelled the\r\nrespect and even the fear of those who met him. For the law, too, and\r\nall who were connected with it, he exhibited a bitter contempt which\r\ndelighted some and alarmed others of his fellow boarders.\r\n\r\nFrom the first he made it evident, by his open admiration, that the\r\ndaughter of the house had won his heart from the instant that he had\r\nset eyes upon her beauty and her grace. He was no backward suitor. On\r\nthe second day he told her that he loved her, and from then onward he\r\nrepeated the same story with an absolute disregard of what she might\r\nsay to discourage him.\r\n\r\n\u201cSomeone else?\u201d he would cry. \u201cWell, the worse luck for someone else!\r\nLet him look out for himself! Am I to lose my life\u2019s chance and all my\r\nheart\u2019s desire for someone else? You can keep on saying no, Ettie: the\r\nday will come when you will say yes, and I\u2019m young enough to wait.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was a dangerous suitor, with his glib Irish tongue, and his pretty,\r\ncoaxing ways. There was about him also that glamour of experience and\r\nof mystery which attracts a woman\u2019s interest, and finally her love. He\r\ncould talk of the sweet valleys of County Monaghan from which he came,\r\nof the lovely, distant island, the low hills and green meadows of which\r\nseemed the more beautiful when imagination viewed them from this place\r\nof grime and snow.\r\n\r\nThen he was versed in the life of the cities of the North, of Detroit,\r\nand the lumber camps of Michigan, and finally of Chicago, where he had\r\nworked in a planing mill. And afterwards came the hint of romance, the\r\nfeeling that strange things had happened to him in that great city, so\r\nstrange and so intimate that they might not be spoken of. He spoke\r\nwistfully of a sudden leaving, a breaking of old ties, a flight into a\r\nstrange world, ending in this dreary valley, and Ettie listened, her\r\ndark eyes gleaming with pity and with sympathy\u2014those two qualities\r\nwhich may turn so rapidly and so naturally to love.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo had obtained a temporary job as bookkeeper for he was a\r\nwell-educated man. This kept him out most of the day, and he had not\r\nfound occasion yet to report himself to the head of the lodge of the\r\nEminent Order of Freemen. He was reminded of his omission, however, by\r\na visit one evening from Mike Scanlan, the fellow member whom he had\r\nmet in the train. Scanlan, the small, sharp-faced, nervous, black-eyed\r\nman, seemed glad to see him once more. After a glass or two of whisky\r\nhe broached the object of his visit.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, McMurdo,\u201d said he, \u201cI remembered your address, so I made bold to\r\ncall. I\u2019m surprised that you\u2019ve not reported to the Bodymaster. Why\r\nhaven\u2019t you seen Boss McGinty yet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I had to find a job. I have been busy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must find time for him if you have none for anything else. Good\r\nLord, man! you\u2019re a fool not to have been down to the Union House and\r\nregistered your name the first morning after you came here! If you run\r\nagainst him\u2014well, you mustn\u2019t, that\u2019s all!\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo showed mild surprise. \u201cI\u2019ve been a member of the lodge for over\r\ntwo years, Scanlan, but I never heard that duties were so pressing as\r\nall that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe not in Chicago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s the same society here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it?\u201d\r\n\r\nScanlan looked at him long and fixedly. There was something sinister in\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll tell me that in a month\u2019s time. I hear you had a talk with the\r\npatrolmen after I left the train.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it got about\u2014things do get about for good and for bad in this\r\ndistrict.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, yes. I told the hounds what I thought of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the Lord, you\u2019ll be a man after McGinty\u2019s heart!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, does he hate the police too?\u201d\r\n\r\nScanlan burst out laughing. \u201cYou go and see him, my lad,\u201d said he as he\r\ntook his leave. \u201cIt\u2019s not the police but you that he\u2019ll hate if you\r\ndon\u2019t! Now, take a friend\u2019s advice and go at once!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt chanced that on the same evening McMurdo had another more pressing\r\ninterview which urged him in the same direction. It may have been that\r\nhis attentions to Ettie had been more evident than before, or that they\r\nhad gradually obtruded themselves into the slow mind of his good German\r\nhost; but, whatever the cause, the boarding-house keeper beckoned the\r\nyoung man into his private room and started on the subject without any\r\ncircumlocution.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me, mister,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you are gettin\u2019 set on my\r\nEttie. Ain\u2019t that so, or am I wrong?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that is so,\u201d the young man answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cVell, I vant to tell you right now that it ain\u2019t no manner of use.\r\nThere\u2019s someone slipped in afore you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe told me so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVell, you can lay that she told you truth. But did she tell you who it\r\nvas?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I asked her; but she wouldn\u2019t tell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI dare say not, the leetle baggage! Perhaps she did not vish to\r\nfrighten you avay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrighten!\u201d McMurdo was on fire in a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, my friend! You need not be ashamed to be frightened of him.\r\nIt is Teddy Baldwin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who the devil is he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is a boss of Scowrers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cScowrers! I\u2019ve heard of them before. It\u2019s Scowrers here and Scowrers\r\nthere, and always in a whisper! What are you all afraid of? Who are the\r\nScowrers?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boarding-house keeper instinctively sank his voice, as everyone did\r\nwho talked about that terrible society. \u201cThe Scowrers,\u201d said he, \u201care\r\nthe Eminent Order of Freemen!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young man stared. \u201cWhy, I am a member of that order myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou! I vould never have had you in my house if I had known it\u2014not if\r\nyou vere to pay me a hundred dollar a veek.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the order? It\u2019s for charity and good fellowship. The\r\nrules say so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe in some places. Not here!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a murder society, that\u2019s vat it is.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo laughed incredulously. \u201cHow can you prove that?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cProve it! Are there not fifty murders to prove it? Vat about Milman\r\nand Van Shorst, and the Nicholson family, and old Mr. Hyam, and little\r\nBilly James, and the others? Prove it! Is there a man or a voman in\r\nthis valley vat does not know it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here!\u201d said McMurdo earnestly. \u201cI want you to take back what\r\nyou\u2019ve said, or else make it good. One or the other you must do before\r\nI quit this room. Put yourself in my place. Here am I, a stranger in\r\nthe town. I belong to a society that I know only as an innocent one.\r\nYou\u2019ll find it through the length and breadth of the States, but always\r\nas an innocent one. Now, when I am counting upon joining it here, you\r\ntell me that it is the same as a murder society called the Scowrers. I\r\nguess you owe me either an apology or else an explanation, Mr.\r\nShafter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can but tell you vat the whole vorld knows, mister. The bosses of\r\nthe one are the bosses of the other. If you offend the one, it is the\r\nother vat vill strike you. We have proved it too often.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just gossip\u2014I want proof!\u201d said McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you live here long you vill get your proof. But I forget that you\r\nare yourself one of them. You vill soon be as bad as the rest. But you\r\nvill find other lodgings, mister. I cannot have you here. Is it not bad\r\nenough that one of these people come courting my Ettie, and that I dare\r\nnot turn him down, but that I should have another for my boarder? Yes,\r\nindeed, you shall not sleep here after to-night!\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo found himself under sentence of banishment both from his\r\ncomfortable quarters and from the girl whom he loved. He found her\r\nalone in the sitting-room that same evening, and he poured his troubles\r\ninto her ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, your father is after giving me notice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s little I\r\nwould care if it was just my room, but indeed, Ettie, though it\u2019s only\r\na week that I\u2019ve known you, you are the very breath of life to me, and\r\nI can\u2019t live without you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, hush, Mr. McMurdo, don\u2019t speak so!\u201d said the girl. \u201cI have told\r\nyou, have I not, that you are too late? There is another, and if I have\r\nnot promised to marry him at once, at least I can promise no one else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose I had been first, Ettie, would I have had a chance?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl sank her face into her hands. \u201cI wish to heaven that you had\r\nbeen first!\u201d she sobbed.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo was down on his knees before her in an instant. \u201cFor God\u2019s\r\nsake, Ettie, let it stand at that!\u201d he cried. \u201cWill you ruin your life\r\nand my own for the sake of this promise? Follow your heart, acushla!\r\n\u2019Tis a safer guide than any promise before you knew what it was that\r\nyou were saying.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had seized Ettie\u2019s white hand between his own strong brown ones.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay that you will be mine, and we will face it out together!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, Jack!\u201d His arms were round her now. \u201cIt could not be here.\r\nCould you take me away?\u201d\r\n\r\nA struggle passed for a moment over McMurdo\u2019s face; but it ended by\r\nsetting like granite. \u201cNo, here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll hold you against the\r\nworld, Ettie, right here where we are!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should we not leave together?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Ettie, I can\u2019t leave here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d never hold my head up again if I felt that I had been driven out.\r\nBesides, what is there to be afraid of? Are we not free folks in a free\r\ncountry? If you love me, and I you, who will dare to come between?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know, Jack. You\u2019ve been here too short a time. You don\u2019t\r\nknow this Baldwin. You don\u2019t know McGinty and his Scowrers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know them, and I don\u2019t fear them, and I don\u2019t believe in\r\nthem!\u201d said McMurdo. \u201cI\u2019ve lived among rough men, my darling, and\r\ninstead of fearing them it has always ended that they have feared\r\nme\u2014always, Ettie. It\u2019s mad on the face of it! If these men, as your\r\nfather says, have done crime after crime in the valley, and if everyone\r\nknows them by name, how comes it that none are brought to justice? You\r\nanswer me that, Ettie!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause no witness dares to appear against them. He would not live a\r\nmonth if he did. Also because they have always their own men to swear\r\nthat the accused one was far from the scene of the crime. But surely,\r\nJack, you must have read all this. I had understood that every paper in\r\nthe United States was writing about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have read something, it is true; but I had thought it was a\r\nstory. Maybe these men have some reason in what they do. Maybe they are\r\nwronged and have no other way to help themselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Jack, don\u2019t let me hear you speak so! That is how he speaks\u2014the\r\nother one!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBaldwin\u2014he speaks like that, does he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that is why I loathe him so. Oh, Jack, now I can tell you the\r\ntruth. I loathe him with all my heart; but I fear him also. I fear him\r\nfor myself; but above all I fear him for father. I know that some great\r\nsorrow would come upon us if I dared to say what I really felt. That is\r\nwhy I have put him off with half-promises. It was in real truth our\r\nonly hope. But if you would fly with me, Jack, we could take father\r\nwith us and live forever far from the power of these wicked men.\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain there was the struggle upon McMurdo\u2019s face, and again it set like\r\ngranite. \u201cNo harm shall come to you, Ettie\u2014nor to your father either.\r\nAs to wicked men, I expect you may find that I am as bad as the worst\r\nof them before we\u2019re through.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, Jack! I would trust you anywhere.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo laughed bitterly. \u201cGood Lord! how little you know of me! Your\r\ninnocent soul, my darling, could not even guess what is passing in\r\nmine. But, hullo, who\u2019s the visitor?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe door had opened suddenly, and a young fellow came swaggering in\r\nwith the air of one who is the master. He was a handsome, dashing young\r\nman of about the same age and build as McMurdo himself. Under his\r\nbroad-brimmed black felt hat, which he had not troubled to remove, a\r\nhandsome face with fierce, domineering eyes and a curved hawk-bill of a\r\nnose looked savagely at the pair who sat by the stove.\r\n\r\nEttie had jumped to her feet full of confusion and alarm. \u201cI\u2019m glad to\r\nsee you, Mr. Baldwin,\u201d said she. \u201cYou\u2019re earlier than I had thought.\r\nCome and sit down.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaldwin stood with his hands on his hips looking at McMurdo. \u201cWho is\r\nthis?\u201d he asked curtly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a friend of mine, Mr. Baldwin, a new boarder here. Mr. McMurdo,\r\nmay I introduce you to Mr. Baldwin?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young men nodded in surly fashion to each other.\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe Miss Ettie has told you how it is with us?\u201d said Baldwin.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t understand that there was any relation between you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you? Well, you can understand it now. You can take it from me\r\nthat this young lady is mine, and you\u2019ll find it a very fine evening\r\nfor a walk.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, I am in no humour for a walk.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d The man\u2019s savage eyes were blazing with anger. \u201cMaybe you\r\nare in a humour for a fight, Mr. Boarder!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat I am!\u201d cried McMurdo, springing to his feet. \u201cYou never said a\r\nmore welcome word.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Jack! Oh, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d cried poor, distracted\r\nEttie. \u201cOh, Jack, Jack, he will hurt you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s Jack, is it?\u201d said Baldwin with an oath. \u201cYou\u2019ve come to that\r\nalready, have you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Ted, be reasonable\u2014be kind! For my sake, Ted, if ever you loved\r\nme, be big-hearted and forgiving!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think, Ettie, that if you were to leave us alone we could get this\r\nthing settled,\u201d said McMurdo quietly. \u201cOr maybe, Mr. Baldwin, you will\r\ntake a turn down the street with me. It\u2019s a fine evening, and there\u2019s\r\nsome open ground beyond the next block.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get even with you without needing to dirty my hands,\u201d said his\r\nenemy. \u201cYou\u2019ll wish you had never set foot in this house before I am\r\nthrough with you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo time like the present,\u201d cried McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll choose my own time, mister. You can leave the time to me. See\r\nhere!\u201d He suddenly rolled up his sleeve and showed upon his forearm a\r\npeculiar sign which appeared to have been branded there. It was a\r\ncircle with a triangle within it. \u201cD\u2019you know what that means?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI neither know nor care!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you will know, I\u2019ll promise you that. You won\u2019t be much older,\r\neither. Perhaps Miss Ettie can tell you something about it. As to you,\r\nEttie, you\u2019ll come back to me on your knees\u2014d\u2019ye hear, girl?\u2014on your\r\nknees\u2014and then I\u2019ll tell you what your punishment may be. You\u2019ve\r\nsowed\u2014and by the Lord, I\u2019ll see that you reap!\u201d He glanced at them both\r\nin fury. Then he turned upon his heel, and an instant later the outer\r\ndoor had banged behind him.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments McMurdo and the girl stood in silence. Then she threw\r\nher arms around him.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Jack, how brave you were! But it is no use, you must fly!\r\nTo-night\u2014Jack\u2014to-night! It\u2019s your only hope. He will have your life. I\r\nread it in his horrible eyes. What chance have you against a dozen of\r\nthem, with Boss McGinty and all the power of the lodge behind them?\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo disengaged her hands, kissed her, and gently pushed her back\r\ninto a chair. \u201cThere, acushla, there! Don\u2019t be disturbed or fear for\r\nme. I\u2019m a Freeman myself. I\u2019m after telling your father about it. Maybe\r\nI am no better than the others; so don\u2019t make a saint of me. Perhaps\r\nyou hate me too, now that I\u2019ve told you as much?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHate you, Jack? While life lasts I could never do that! I\u2019ve heard\r\nthat there is no harm in being a Freeman anywhere but here; so why\r\nshould I think the worse of you for that? But if you are a Freeman,\r\nJack, why should you not go down and make a friend of Boss McGinty? Oh,\r\nhurry, Jack, hurry! Get your word in first, or the hounds will be on\r\nyour trail.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was thinking the same thing,\u201d said McMurdo. \u201cI\u2019ll go right now and\r\nfix it. You can tell your father that I\u2019ll sleep here to-night and find\r\nsome other quarters in the morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe bar of McGinty\u2019s saloon was crowded as usual; for it was the\r\nfavourite loafing place of all the rougher elements of the town. The\r\nman was popular; for he had a rough, jovial disposition which formed a\r\nmask, covering a great deal which lay behind it. But apart from this\r\npopularity, the fear in which he was held throughout the township, and\r\nindeed down the whole thirty miles of the valley and past the mountains\r\non each side of it, was enough in itself to fill his bar; for none\r\ncould afford to neglect his good will.\r\n\r\nBesides those secret powers which it was universally believed that he\r\nexercised in so pitiless a fashion, he was a high public official, a\r\nmunicipal councillor, and a commissioner of roads, elected to the\r\noffice through the votes of the ruffians who in turn expected to\r\nreceive favours at his hands. Assessments and taxes were enormous; the\r\npublic works were notoriously neglected, the accounts were slurred over\r\nby bribed auditors, and the decent citizen was terrorized into paying\r\npublic blackmail, and holding his tongue lest some worse thing befall\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThus it was that, year by year, Boss McGinty\u2019s diamond pins became more\r\nobtrusive, his gold chains more weighty across a more gorgeous vest,\r\nand his saloon stretched farther and farther, until it threatened to\r\nabsorb one whole side of the Market Square.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo pushed open the swinging door of the saloon and made his way\r\namid the crowd of men within, through an atmosphere blurred with\r\ntobacco smoke and heavy with the smell of spirits. The place was\r\nbrilliantly lighted, and the huge, heavily gilt mirrors upon every wall\r\nreflected and multiplied the garish illumination. There were several\r\nbartenders in their shirt sleeves, hard at work mixing drinks for the\r\nloungers who fringed the broad, brass-trimmed counter.\r\n\r\nAt the far end, with his body resting upon the bar and a cigar stuck at\r\nan acute angle from the corner of his mouth, stood a tall, strong,\r\nheavily built man who could be none other than the famous McGinty\r\nhimself. He was a black-maned giant, bearded to the cheek-bones, and\r\nwith a shock of raven hair which fell to his collar. His complexion was\r\nas swarthy as that of an Italian, and his eyes were of a strange dead\r\nblack, which, combined with a slight squint, gave them a particularly\r\nsinister appearance.\r\n\r\nAll else in the man\u2014his noble proportions, his fine features, and his\r\nfrank bearing\u2014fitted in with that jovial, man-to-man manner which he\r\naffected. Here, one would say, is a bluff, honest fellow, whose heart\r\nwould be sound however rude his outspoken words might seem. It was only\r\nwhen those dead, dark eyes, deep and remorseless, were turned upon a\r\nman that he shrank within himself, feeling that he was face to face\r\nwith an infinite possibility of latent evil, with a strength and\r\ncourage and cunning behind it which made it a thousand times more\r\ndeadly.\r\n\r\nHaving had a good look at his man, McMurdo elbowed his way forward with\r\nhis usual careless audacity, and pushed himself through the little\r\ngroup of courtiers who were fawning upon the powerful boss, laughing\r\nuproariously at the smallest of his jokes. The young stranger\u2019s bold\r\ngray eyes looked back fearlessly through their glasses at the deadly\r\nblack ones which turned sharply upon him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, young man, I can\u2019t call your face to mind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m new here, Mr. McGinty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not so new that you can\u2019t give a gentleman his proper title.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s Councillor McGinty, young man,\u201d said a voice from the group.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Councillor. I\u2019m strange to the ways of the place. But I was\r\nadvised to see you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you see me. This is all there is. What d\u2019you think of me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s early days. If your heart is as big as your body, and your\r\nsoul as fine as your face, then I\u2019d ask for nothing better,\u201d said\r\nMcMurdo.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \u201cIf your heart is as big as your body, and your soul\r\nas fine as your face, then I\u2019d ask for nothing better,\u201d said McMurdo.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBy Gar! you\u2019ve got an Irish tongue in your head anyhow,\u201d cried the\r\nsaloon-keeper, not quite certain whether to humour this audacious\r\nvisitor or to stand upon his dignity.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you are good enough to pass my appearance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you were told to see me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who told you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBrother Scanlan of Lodge 341, Vermissa. I drink your health\r\nCouncillor, and to our better acquaintance.\u201d He raised a glass with\r\nwhich he had been served to his lips and elevated his little finger as\r\nhe drank it.\r\n\r\nMcGinty, who had been watching him narrowly, raised his thick black\r\neyebrows. \u201cOh, it\u2019s like that, is it?\u201d said he. \u201cI\u2019ll have to look a\r\nbit closer into this, Mister\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMcMurdo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA bit closer, Mr. McMurdo; for we don\u2019t take folk on trust in these\r\nparts, nor believe all we\u2019re told neither. Come in here for a moment,\r\nbehind the bar.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a small room there, lined with barrels. McGinty carefully\r\nclosed the door, and then seated himself on one of them, biting\r\nthoughtfully on his cigar and surveying his companion with those\r\ndisquieting eyes. For a couple of minutes he sat in complete silence.\r\nMcMurdo bore the inspection cheerfully, one hand in his coat pocket,\r\nthe other twisting his brown moustache. Suddenly McGinty stooped and\r\nproduced a wicked-looking revolver.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here, my joker,\u201d said he, \u201cif I thought you were playing any game\r\non us, it would be short work for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a strange welcome,\u201d McMurdo answered with some dignity, \u201cfor\r\nthe Bodymaster of a lodge of Freemen to give to a stranger brother.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, but it\u2019s just that same that you have to prove,\u201d said McGinty,\r\n\u201cand God help you if you fail! Where were you made?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLodge 29, Chicago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJune 24, 1872.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat Bodymaster?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJames H. Scott.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is your district ruler?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBartholomew Wilson.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum! You seem glib enough in your tests. What are you doing here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWorking, the same as you\u2014but a poorer job.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have your back answer quick enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I was always quick of speech.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you quick of action?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have had that name among those that knew me best.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we may try you sooner than you think. Have you heard anything of\r\nthe lodge in these parts?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that it takes a man to be a brother.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue for you, Mr. McMurdo. Why did you leave Chicago?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m damned if I tell you that!\u201d\r\n\r\nMcGinty opened his eyes. He was not used to being answered in such\r\nfashion, and it amused him. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause no brother may tell another a lie.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen the truth is too bad to tell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can put it that way if you like.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here, mister, you can\u2019t expect me, as Bodymaster, to pass into the\r\nlodge a man for whose past he can\u2019t answer.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo looked puzzled. Then he took a worn newspaper cutting from an\r\ninner pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t squeal on a fellow?\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll wipe my hand across your face if you say such words to me!\u201d cried\r\nMcGinty hotly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are right, Councillor,\u201d said McMurdo meekly. \u201cI should apologize.\r\nI spoke without thought. Well, I know that I am safe in your hands.\r\nLook at that clipping.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcGinty glanced his eyes over the account of the shooting of one Jonas\r\nPinto, in the Lake Saloon, Market Street, Chicago, in the New Year week\r\nof 1874.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour work?\u201d he asked, as he handed back the paper.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you shoot him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was helping Uncle Sam to make dollars. Maybe mine were not as good\r\ngold as his, but they looked as well and were cheaper to make. This man\r\nPinto helped me to shove the queer\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo do what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it means to pass the dollars out into circulation. Then he said\r\nhe would split. Maybe he did split. I didn\u2019t wait to see. I just killed\r\nhim and lighted out for the coal country.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy the coal country?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019d read in the papers that they weren\u2019t too particular in\r\nthose parts.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcGinty laughed. \u201cYou were first a coiner and then a murderer, and you\r\ncame to these parts because you thought you\u2019d be welcome.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s about the size of it,\u201d McMurdo answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I guess you\u2019ll go far. Say, can you make those dollars yet?\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo took half a dozen from his pocket. \u201cThose never passed the\r\nPhiladelphia mint,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say!\u201d McGinty held them to the light in his enormous hand,\r\nwhich was hairy as a gorilla\u2019s. \u201cI can see no difference. Gar! you\u2019ll\r\nbe a mighty useful brother, I\u2019m thinking! We can do with a bad man or\r\ntwo among us, Friend McMurdo: for there are times when we have to take\r\nour own part. We\u2019d soon be against the wall if we didn\u2019t shove back at\r\nthose that were pushing us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll do my share of shoving with the rest of the boys.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to have a good nerve. You didn\u2019t squirm when I shoved this\r\ngun at you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was not me that was in danger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was you, Councillor.\u201d McMurdo drew a cocked pistol from the side\r\npocket of his peajacket. \u201cI was covering you all the time. I guess my\r\nshot would have been as quick as yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy Gar!\u201d McGinty flushed an angry red and then burst into a roar of\r\nlaughter. \u201cSay, we\u2019ve had no such holy terror come to hand this many a\r\nyear. I reckon the lodge will learn to be proud of you.... Well, what\r\nthe hell do you want? And can\u2019t I speak alone with a gentleman for five\r\nminutes but you must butt in on us?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe bartender stood abashed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Councillor, but it\u2019s Ted\r\nBaldwin. He says he must see you this very minute.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe message was unnecessary; for the set, cruel face of the man himself\r\nwas looking over the servant\u2019s shoulder. He pushed the bartender out\r\nand closed the door on him.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d said he with a furious glance at McMurdo, \u201cyou got here first,\r\ndid you? I\u2019ve a word to say to you, Councillor, about this man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen say it here and now before my face,\u201d cried McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say it at my own time, in my own way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTut! Tut!\u201d said McGinty, getting off his barrel. \u201cThis will never do.\r\nWe have a new brother here, Baldwin, and it\u2019s not for us to greet him\r\nin such fashion. Hold out your hand, man, and make it up!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever!\u201d cried Baldwin in a fury.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve offered to fight him if he thinks I have wronged him,\u201d said\r\nMcMurdo. \u201cI\u2019ll fight him with fists, or, if that won\u2019t satisfy him,\r\nI\u2019ll fight him any other way he chooses. Now, I\u2019ll leave it to you,\r\nCouncillor, to judge between us as a Bodymaster should.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA young lady. She\u2019s free to choose for herself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs she?\u201d cried Baldwin.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs between two brothers of the lodge I should say that she was,\u201d said\r\nthe Boss.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s your ruling, is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it is, Ted Baldwin,\u201d said McGinty, with a wicked stare. \u201cIs it\r\nyou that would dispute it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in\r\nfavour of a man that you never saw before in your life? You\u2019re not\r\nBodymaster for life, Jack McGinty, and by God! when next it comes to a\r\nvote\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Councillor sprang at him like a tiger. His hand closed round the\r\nother\u2019s neck, and he hurled him back across one of the barrels. In his\r\nmad fury he would have squeezed the life out of him if McMurdo had not\r\ninterfered.\r\n\r\n\u201cEasy, Councillor! For heaven\u2019s sake, go easy!\u201d he cried, as he dragged\r\nhim back.\r\n\r\nMcGinty released his hold, and Baldwin, cowed and shaken gasping for\r\nbreath, and shivering in every limb, as one who has looked over the\r\nvery edge of death, sat up on the barrel over which he had been hurled.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been asking for it this many a day, Ted Baldwin\u2014now you\u2019ve got\r\nit!\u201d cried McGinty, his huge chest rising and falling. \u201cMaybe you think\r\nif I was voted down from Bodymaster you would find yourself in my\r\nshoes. It\u2019s for the lodge to say that. But so long as I am the chief\r\nI\u2019ll have no man lift his voice against me or my rulings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have nothing against you,\u201d mumbled Baldwin, feeling his throat.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d cried the other, relapsing in a moment into a bluff\r\njoviality, \u201cwe are all good friends again and there\u2019s an end of the\r\nmatter.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took a bottle of champagne down from the shelf and twisted out the\r\ncork.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee now,\u201d he continued, as he filled three high glasses. \u201cLet us drink\r\nthe quarrelling toast of the lodge. After that, as you know, there can\r\nbe no bad blood between us. Now, then the left hand on the apple of my\r\nthroat. I say to you, Ted Baldwin, what is the offense, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe clouds are heavy,\u201d answered Baldwin\r\n\r\n\u201cBut they will forever brighten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd this I swear!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe men drank their glasses, and the same ceremony was performed\r\nbetween Baldwin and McMurdo\r\n\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d cried McGinty, rubbing his hands. \u201cThat\u2019s the end of the black\r\nblood. You come under lodge discipline if it goes further, and that\u2019s a\r\nheavy hand in these parts, as Brother Baldwin knows\u2014and as you will\r\ndamn soon find out, Brother McMurdo, if you ask for trouble!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFaith, I\u2019d be slow to do that,\u201d said McMurdo. He held out his hand to\r\nBaldwin. \u201cI\u2019m quick to quarrel and quick to forgive. It\u2019s my hot Irish\r\nblood, they tell me. But it\u2019s over for me, and I bear no grudge.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaldwin had to take the proffered hand; for the baleful eye of the\r\nterrible Boss was upon him. But his sullen face showed how little the\r\nwords of the other had moved him.\r\n\r\nMcGinty clapped them both on the shoulders. \u201cTut! These girls! These\r\ngirls!\u201d he cried. \u201cTo think that the same petticoats should come\r\nbetween two of my boys! It\u2019s the devil\u2019s own luck! Well, it\u2019s the\r\ncolleen inside of them that must settle the question; for it\u2019s outside\r\nthe jurisdiction of a Bodymaster\u2014and the Lord be praised for that! We\r\nhave enough on us, without the women as well. You\u2019ll have to be\r\naffiliated to Lodge 341, Brother McMurdo. We have our own ways and\r\nmethods, different from Chicago. Saturday night is our meeting, and if\r\nyou come then, we\u2019ll make you free forever of the Vermissa Valley.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\nLodge 341, Vermissa\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day following the evening which had contained so many exciting\r\nevents, McMurdo moved his lodgings from old Jacob Shafter\u2019s and took up\r\nhis quarters at the Widow MacNamara\u2019s on the extreme outskirts of the\r\ntown. Scanlan, his original acquaintance aboard the train, had occasion\r\nshortly afterwards to move into Vermissa, and the two lodged together.\r\nThere was no other boarder, and the hostess was an easy-going old\r\nIrishwoman who left them to themselves; so that they had a freedom for\r\nspeech and action welcome to men who had secrets in common.\r\n\r\nShafter had relented to the extent of letting McMurdo come to his meals\r\nthere when he liked; so that his intercourse with Ettie was by no means\r\nbroken. On the contrary, it drew closer and more intimate as the weeks\r\nwent by.\r\n\r\nIn his bedroom at his new abode McMurdo felt it safe to take out the\r\ncoining moulds, and under many a pledge of secrecy a number of brothers\r\nfrom the lodge were allowed to come in and see them, each carrying away\r\nin his pocket some examples of the false money, so cunningly struck\r\nthat there was never the slightest difficulty or danger in passing it.\r\nWhy, with such a wonderful art at his command, McMurdo should\r\ncondescend to work at all was a perpetual mystery to his companions;\r\nthough he made it clear to anyone who asked him that if he lived\r\nwithout any visible means it would very quickly bring the police upon\r\nhis track.\r\n\r\nOne policeman was indeed after him already; but the incident, as luck\r\nwould have it, did the adventurer a great deal more good than harm.\r\nAfter the first introduction there were few evenings when he did not\r\nfind his way to McGinty\u2019s saloon, there to make closer acquaintance\r\nwith \u201cthe boys,\u201d which was the jovial title by which the dangerous gang\r\nwho infested the place were known to one another. His dashing manner\r\nand fearlessness of speech made him a favourite with them all; while\r\nthe rapid and scientific way in which he polished off his antagonist in\r\nan \u201call in\u201d bar-room scrap earned the respect of that rough community.\r\nAnother incident, however, raised him even higher in their estimation.\r\n\r\nJust at the crowded hour one night, the door opened and a man entered\r\nwith the quiet blue uniform and peaked cap of the mine police. This was\r\na special body raised by the railways and colliery owners to supplement\r\nthe efforts of the ordinary civil police, who were perfectly helpless\r\nin the face of the organized ruffianism which terrorized the district.\r\nThere was a hush as he entered, and many a curious glance was cast at\r\nhim; but the relations between policemen and criminals are peculiar in\r\nsome parts of the States, and McGinty himself, standing behind his\r\ncounter, showed no surprise when the policeman enrolled himself among\r\nhis customers.\r\n\r\n\u201cA straight whisky; for the night is bitter,\u201d said the police officer.\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have met before, Councillor?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be the new captain?\u201d said McGinty.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so. We\u2019re looking to you, Councillor, and to the other leading\r\ncitizens, to help us in upholding law and order in this township.\r\nCaptain Marvin is my name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019d do better without you, Captain Marvin,\u201d said McGinty coldly; \u201cfor\r\nwe have our own police of the township, and no need for any imported\r\ngoods. What are you but the paid tool of the capitalists, hired by them\r\nto club or shoot your poorer fellow citizen?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well, we won\u2019t argue about that,\u201d said the police officer\r\ngood-humouredly. \u201cI expect we all do our duty same as we see it; but we\r\ncan\u2019t all see it the same.\u201d He had drunk off his glass and had turned\r\nto go, when his eyes fell upon the face of Jack McMurdo, who was\r\nscowling at his elbow. \u201cHullo! Hullo!\u201d he cried, looking him up and\r\ndown. \u201cHere\u2019s an old acquaintance!\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo shrank away from him. \u201cI was never a friend to you nor any\r\nother cursed copper in my life,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn acquaintance isn\u2019t always a friend,\u201d said the police captain,\r\ngrinning. \u201cYou\u2019re Jack McMurdo of Chicago, right enough, and don\u2019t you\r\ndeny it!\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not denying it,\u201d said he. \u201cD\u2019ye\r\nthink I\u2019m ashamed of my own name?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got good cause to be, anyhow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the devil d\u2019you mean by that?\u201d he roared with his fists clenched.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, Jack, bluster won\u2019t do with me. I was an officer in Chicago\r\nbefore ever I came to this darned coal bunker, and I know a Chicago\r\ncrook when I see one.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo\u2019s face fell. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re Marvin of the Chicago\r\nCentral!\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust the same old Teddy Marvin, at your service. We haven\u2019t forgotten\r\nthe shooting of Jonas Pinto up there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never shot him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you not? That\u2019s good impartial evidence, ain\u2019t it? Well, his death\r\ncame in uncommon handy for you, or they would have had you for shoving\r\nthe queer. Well, we can let that be bygones; for, between you and\r\nme\u2014and perhaps I\u2019m going further than my duty in saying it\u2014they could\r\nget no clear case against you, and Chicago\u2019s open to you to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very well where I am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve given you the pointer, and you\u2019re a sulky dog not to thank\r\nme for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose you mean well, and I do thank you,\u201d said McMurdo in no\r\nvery gracious manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s mum with me so long as I see you living on the straight,\u201d said\r\nthe captain. \u201cBut, by the Lord! if you get off after this, it\u2019s another\r\nstory! So good-night to you\u2014and good-night, Councillor.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe left the bar-room; but not before he had created a local hero.\r\nMcMurdo\u2019s deeds in far Chicago had been whispered before. He had put\r\noff all questions with a smile, as one who did not wish to have\r\ngreatness thrust upon him. But now the thing was officially confirmed.\r\nThe bar loafers crowded round him and shook him heartily by the hand.\r\nHe was free of the community from that time on. He could drink hard and\r\nshow little trace of it; but that evening, had his mate Scanlan not\r\nbeen at hand to lead him home, the feted hero would surely have spent\r\nhis night under the bar.\r\n\r\nOn a Saturday night McMurdo was introduced to the lodge. He had thought\r\nto pass in without ceremony as being an initiate of Chicago; but there\r\nwere particular rites in Vermissa of which they were proud, and these\r\nhad to be undergone by every postulant. The assembly met in a large\r\nroom reserved for such purposes at the Union House. Some sixty members\r\nassembled at Vermissa; but that by no means represented the full\r\nstrength of the organization, for there were several other lodges in\r\nthe valley, and others across the mountains on each side, who exchanged\r\nmembers when any serious business was afoot, so that a crime might be\r\ndone by men who were strangers to the locality. Altogether there were\r\nnot less than five hundred scattered over the coal district.\r\n\r\nIn the bare assembly room the men were gathered round a long table. At\r\nthe side was a second one laden with bottles and glasses, on which some\r\nmembers of the company were already turning their eyes. McGinty sat at\r\nthe head with a flat black velvet cap upon his shock of tangled black\r\nhair, and a coloured purple stole round his neck, so that he seemed to\r\nbe a priest presiding over some diabolical ritual. To right and left of\r\nhim were the higher lodge officials, the cruel, handsome face of Ted\r\nBaldwin among them. Each of these wore some scarf or medallion as\r\nemblem of his office.\r\n\r\nThey were, for the most part, men of mature age; but the rest of the\r\ncompany consisted of young fellows from eighteen to twenty-five, the\r\nready and capable agents who carried out the commands of their seniors.\r\nAmong the older men were many whose features showed the tigerish,\r\nlawless souls within; but looking at the rank and file it was difficult\r\nto believe that these eager and open-faced young fellows were in very\r\ntruth a dangerous gang of murderers, whose minds had suffered such\r\ncomplete moral perversion that they took a horrible pride in their\r\nproficiency at the business, and looked with deepest respect at the man\r\nwho had the reputation of making what they called \u201ca clean job.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo their contorted natures it had become a spirited and chivalrous\r\nthing to volunteer for service against some man who had never injured\r\nthem, and whom in many cases they had never seen in their lives. The\r\ncrime committed, they quarrelled as to who had actually struck the\r\nfatal blow, and amused one another and the company by describing the\r\ncries and contortions of the murdered man.\r\n\r\nAt first they had shown some secrecy in their arrangements; but at the\r\ntime which this narrative describes their proceedings were\r\nextraordinarily open, for the repeated failure of the law had proved to\r\nthem that, on the one hand, no one would dare to witness against them,\r\nand on the other they had an unlimited number of stanch witnesses upon\r\nwhom they could call, and a well-filled treasure chest from which they\r\ncould draw the funds to engage the best legal talent in the state. In\r\nten long years of outrage there had been no single conviction, and the\r\nonly danger that ever threatened the Scowrers lay in the victim\r\nhimself\u2014who, however outnumbered and taken by surprise, might and\r\noccasionally did leave his mark upon his assailants.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo had been warned that some ordeal lay before him; but no one\r\nwould tell him in what it consisted. He was led now into an outer room\r\nby two solemn brothers. Through the plank partition he could hear the\r\nmurmur of many voices from the assembly within. Once or twice he caught\r\nthe sound of his own name, and he knew that they were discussing his\r\ncandidacy. Then there entered an inner guard with a green and gold sash\r\nacross his chest.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Bodymaster orders that he shall be trussed, blinded, and entered,\u201d\r\nsaid he.\r\n\r\nThe three of them removed his coat, turned up the sleeve of his right\r\narm, and finally passed a rope round above the elbows and made it fast.\r\nThey next placed a thick black cap right over his head and the upper\r\npart of his face, so that he could see nothing. He was then led into\r\nthe assembly hall.\r\n\r\nIt was pitch dark and very oppressive under his hood. He heard the\r\nrustle and murmur of the people round him, and then the voice of\r\nMcGinty sounded dull and distant through the covering of his ears.\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn McMurdo,\u201d said the voice, \u201care you already a member of the\r\nAncient Order of Freemen?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe bowed in assent.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs your lodge No. 29, Chicago?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe bowed again.\r\n\r\n\u201cDark nights are unpleasant,\u201d said the voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, for strangers to travel,\u201d he answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe clouds are heavy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, a storm is approaching.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre the brethren satisfied?\u201d asked the Bodymaster.\r\n\r\nThere was a general murmur of assent.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe know, Brother, by your sign and by your countersign that you are\r\nindeed one of us,\u201d said McGinty. \u201cWe would have you know, however, that\r\nin this county and in other counties of these parts we have certain\r\nrites, and also certain duties of our own which call for good men. Are\r\nyou ready to be tested?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you of stout heart?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTake a stride forward to prove it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the words were said he felt two hard points in front of his eyes,\r\npressing upon them so that it appeared as if he could not move forward\r\nwithout a danger of losing them. None the less, he nerved himself to\r\nstep resolutely out, and as he did so the pressure melted away. There\r\nwas a low murmur of applause.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is of stout heart,\u201d said the voice. \u201cCan you bear pain?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs well as another,\u201d he answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cTest him!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was all he could do to keep himself from screaming out, for an\r\nagonizing pain shot through his forearm. He nearly fainted at the\r\nsudden shock of it; but he bit his lip and clenched his hands to hide\r\nhis agony.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: It was all he could do to keep himself from screaming\r\nout.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI can take more than that,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\nThis time there was loud applause. A finer first appearance had never\r\nbeen made in the lodge. Hands clapped him on the back, and the hood was\r\nplucked from his head. He stood blinking and smiling amid the\r\ncongratulations of the brothers.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne last word, Brother McMurdo,\u201d said McGinty. \u201cYou have already sworn\r\nthe oath of secrecy and fidelity, and you are aware that the punishment\r\nfor any breach of it is instant and inevitable death?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am,\u201d said McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you accept the rule of the Bodymaster for the time being under all\r\ncircumstances?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen in the name of Lodge 341, Vermissa, I welcome you to its\r\nprivileges and debates. You will put the liquor on the table, Brother\r\nScanlan, and we will drink to our worthy brother.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo\u2019s coat had been brought to him; but before putting it on he\r\nexamined his right arm, which still smarted heavily. There on the flesh\r\nof the forearm was a circle with a triangle within it, deep and red, as\r\nthe branding iron had left it. One or two of his neighbours pulled up\r\ntheir sleeves and showed their own lodge marks.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all had it,\u201d said one; \u201cbut not all as brave as you over it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTut! It was nothing,\u201d said he; but it burned and ached all the same.\r\n\r\nWhen the drinks which followed the ceremony of initiation had all been\r\ndisposed of, the business of the lodge proceeded. McMurdo, accustomed\r\nonly to the prosaic performances of Chicago, listened with open ears\r\nand more surprise than he ventured to show to what followed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first business on the agenda paper,\u201d said McGinty, \u201cis to read the\r\nfollowing letter from Division Master Windle of Merton County Lodge\r\n249. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018DEAR SIR.\u2014\u201cThere is a job to be done on Andrew Rae of Rae & Sturmash,\r\ncoal owners near this place. You will remember that your lodge owes us\r\na return, having had the service of two brethren in the matter of the\r\npatrolman last fall. You will send two good men, they will be taken\r\ncharge of by Treasurer Higgins of this lodge, whose address you know.\r\nHe will show them when to act and where. Yours in freedom,\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018J.W. WINDLE D.M.A.O.F.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWindle has never refused us when we have had occasion to ask for the\r\nloan of a man or two, and it is not for us to refuse him.\u201d McGinty\r\npaused and looked round the room with his dull, malevolent eyes. \u201cWho\r\nwill volunteer for the job?\u201d\r\n\r\nSeveral young fellows held up their hands. The Bodymaster looked at\r\nthem with an approving smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do, Tiger Cormac. If you handle it as well as you did the last,\r\nyou won\u2019t be wrong. And you, Wilson.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve no pistol,\u201d said the volunteer, a mere boy in his teens.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s your first, is it not? Well, you have to be blooded some time. It\r\nwill be a great start for you. As to the pistol, you\u2019ll find it waiting\r\nfor you, or I\u2019m mistaken. If you report yourselves on Monday, it will\r\nbe time enough. You\u2019ll get a great welcome when you return.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAny reward this time?\u201d asked Cormac, a thick-set, dark-faced,\r\nbrutal-looking young man, whose ferocity had earned him the nickname of\r\n\u201cTiger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind the reward. You just do it for the honour of the thing.\r\nMaybe when it is done there will be a few odd dollars at the bottom of\r\nthe box.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat has the man done?\u201d asked young Wilson.\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, it\u2019s not for the likes of you to ask what the man has done. He\r\nhas been judged over there. That\u2019s no business of ours. All we have to\r\ndo is to carry it out for them, same as they would for us. Speaking of\r\nthat, two brothers from the Merton lodge are coming over to us next\r\nweek to do some business in this quarter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are they?\u201d asked someone.\r\n\r\n\u201cFaith, it is wiser not to ask. If you know nothing, you can testify\r\nnothing, and no trouble can come of it. But they are men who will make\r\na clean job when they are about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd time, too!\u201d cried Ted Baldwin. \u201cFolk are gettin\u2019 out of hand in\r\nthese parts. It was only last week that three of our men were turned\r\noff by Foreman Blaker. It\u2019s been owing him a long time, and he\u2019ll get\r\nit full and proper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGet what?\u201d McMurdo whispered to his neighbour.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe business end of a buckshot cartridge!\u201d cried the man with a loud\r\nlaugh. \u201cWhat think you of our ways, Brother?\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo\u2019s criminal soul seemed to have already absorbed the spirit of\r\nthe vile association of which he was now a member. \u201cI like it well,\u201d\r\nsaid he. \u201c\u2019Tis a proper place for a lad of mettle.\u201d\r\n\r\nSeveral of those who sat around heard his words and applauded them.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d cried the black-maned Bodymaster from the end of the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Tis our new brother, sir, who finds our ways to his taste.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo rose to his feet for an instant. \u201cI would say, Eminent\r\nBodymaster, that if a man should be wanted I should take it as an\r\nhonour to be chosen to help the lodge.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was great applause at this. It was felt that a new sun was\r\npushing its rim above the horizon. To some of the elders it seemed that\r\nthe progress was a little too rapid.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would move,\u201d said the secretary, Harraway, a vulture-faced old\r\ngraybeard who sat near the chairman, \u201cthat Brother McMurdo should wait\r\nuntil it is the good pleasure of the lodge to employ him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, that was what I meant; I\u2019m in your hands,\u201d said McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour time will come, Brother,\u201d said the chairman. \u201cWe have marked you\r\ndown as a willing man, and we believe that you will do good work in\r\nthese parts. There is a small matter to-night in which you may take a\r\nhand if it so please you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will wait for something that is worth while.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can come to-night, anyhow, and it will help you to know what we\r\nstand for in this community. I will make the announcement later.\r\nMeanwhile,\u201d he glanced at his agenda paper, \u201cI have one or two more\r\npoints to bring before the meeting. First of all, I will ask the\r\ntreasurer as to our bank balance. There is the pension to Jim\r\nCarnaway\u2019s widow. He was struck down doing the work of the lodge, and\r\nit is for us to see that she is not the loser.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJim was shot last month when they tried to kill Chester Wilcox of\r\nMarley Creek,\u201d McMurdo\u2019s neighbour informed him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe funds are good at the moment,\u201d said the treasurer, with the\r\nbankbook in front of him. \u201cThe firms have been generous of late. Max\r\nLinder & Co. paid five hundred to be left alone. Walker Brothers sent\r\nin a hundred; but I took it on myself to return it and ask for five. If\r\nI do not hear by Wednesday, their winding gear may get out of order. We\r\nhad to burn their breaker last year before they became reasonable. Then\r\nthe West Section Coaling Company has paid its annual contribution. We\r\nhave enough on hand to meet any obligations.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about Archie Swindon?\u201d asked a brother.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has sold out and left the district. The old devil left a note for\r\nus to say that he had rather be a free crossing sweeper in New York\r\nthan a large mine owner under the power of a ring of blackmailers. By\r\nGar! it was as well that he made a break for it before the note reached\r\nus! I guess he won\u2019t show his face in this valley again.\u201d\r\n\r\nAn elderly, clean-shaved man with a kindly face and a good brow rose\r\nfrom the end of the table which faced the chairman. \u201cMr. Treasurer,\u201d he\r\nasked, \u201cmay I ask who has bought the property of this man that we have\r\ndriven out of the district?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Brother Morris. It has been bought by the State & Merton County\r\nRailroad Company.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who bought the mines of Todman and of Lee that came into the\r\nmarket in the same way last year?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe same company, Brother Morris.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who bought the ironworks of Manson and of Shuman and of Van Deher\r\nand of Atwood, which have all been given up of late?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were all bought by the West Gilmerton General Mining Company.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see, Brother Morris,\u201d said the chairman, \u201cthat it matters to\r\nus who buys them, since they can\u2019t carry them out of the district.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith all respect to you, Eminent Bodymaster, I think it may matter\r\nvery much to us. This process has been going on now for ten long years.\r\nWe are gradually driving all the small men out of trade. What is the\r\nresult? We find in their places great companies like the Railroad or\r\nthe General Iron, who have their directors in New York or Philadelphia,\r\nand care nothing for our threats. We can take it out of their local\r\nbosses; but it only means that others will be sent in their stead. And\r\nwe are making it dangerous for ourselves. The small men could not harm\r\nus. They had not the money nor the power. So long as we did not squeeze\r\nthem too dry, they would stay on under our power. But if these big\r\ncompanies find that we stand between them and their profits, they will\r\nspare no pains and no expense to hunt us down and bring us to court.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a hush at these ominous words, and every face darkened as\r\ngloomy looks were exchanged. So omnipotent and unchallenged had they\r\nbeen that the very thought that there was possible retribution in the\r\nbackground had been banished from their minds. And yet the idea struck\r\na chill to the most reckless of them.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is my advice,\u201d the speaker continued, \u201cthat we go easier upon the\r\nsmall men. On the day that they have all been driven out the power of\r\nthis society will have been broken.\u201d\r\n\r\nUnwelcome truths are not popular. There were angry cries as the speaker\r\nresumed his seat. McGinty rose with gloom upon his brow.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrother Morris,\u201d said he, \u201cyou were always a croaker. So long as the\r\nmembers of this lodge stand together there is no power in the United\r\nStates that can touch them. Sure, have we not tried it often enough in\r\nthe lawcourts? I expect the big companies will find it easier to pay\r\nthan to fight, same as the little companies do. And now, Brethren,\u201d\r\nMcGinty took off his black velvet cap and his stole as he spoke, \u201cthis\r\nlodge has finished its business for the evening, save for one small\r\nmatter which may be mentioned when we are parting. The time has now\r\ncome for fraternal refreshment and for harmony.\u201d\r\n\r\nStrange indeed is human nature. Here were these men, to whom murder was\r\nfamiliar, who again and again had struck down the father of the family,\r\nsome man against whom they had no personal feeling, without one thought\r\nof compunction or of compassion for his weeping wife or helpless\r\nchildren, and yet the tender or pathetic in music could move them to\r\ntears. McMurdo had a fine tenor voice, and if he had failed to gain the\r\ngood will of the lodge before, it could no longer have been withheld\r\nafter he had thrilled them with \u201cI\u2019m Sitting on the Stile, Mary,\u201d and\r\n\u201cOn the Banks of Allan Water.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn his very first night the new recruit had made himself one of the\r\nmost popular of the brethren, marked already for advancement and high\r\noffice. There were other qualities needed, however, besides those of\r\ngood fellowship, to make a worthy Freeman, and of these he was given an\r\nexample before the evening was over. The whisky bottle had passed round\r\nmany times, and the men were flushed and ripe for mischief when their\r\nBodymaster rose once more to address them.\r\n\r\n\u201cBoys,\u201d said he, \u201cthere\u2019s one man in this town that wants trimming up,\r\nand it\u2019s for you to see that he gets it. I\u2019m speaking of James Stanger\r\nof the Herald. You\u2019ve seen how he\u2019s been opening his mouth against us\r\nagain?\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of assent, with many a muttered oath. McGinty took a\r\nslip of paper from his waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Law and Order!\u2019 That\u2019s how he heads it. \u2018Reign of Terror in the Coal\r\nand Iron District. Twelve years have now elapsed since the first\r\nassassinations which proved the existence of a criminal organization in\r\nour midst. From that day these outrages have never ceased, until now\r\nthey have reached a pitch which makes us the opprobrium of the\r\ncivilized world. Is it for such results as this that our great country\r\nwelcomes to its bosom the alien who flies from the despotisms of\r\nEurope? Is it that they shall themselves become tyrants over the very\r\nmen who have given them shelter, and that a state of terrorism and\r\nlawlessness should be established under the very shadow of the sacred\r\nfolds of the starry Flag of Freedom which would raise horror in our\r\nminds if we read of it as existing under the most effete monarchy of\r\nthe East? The men are known. The organization is patent and public. How\r\nlong are we to endure it? Can we forever live\u2014\u2019 Sure, I\u2019ve read enough\r\nof the slush!\u201d cried the chairman, tossing the paper down upon the\r\ntable. \u201cThat\u2019s what he says of us. The question I\u2019m asking you is what\r\nshall we say to him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKill him!\u201d cried a dozen fierce voices.\r\n\r\n\u201cI protest against that,\u201d said Brother Morris, the man of the good brow\r\nand shaved face. \u201cI tell you, Brethren, that our hand is too heavy in\r\nthis valley, and that there will come a point where in self-defense\r\nevery man will unite to crush us out. James Stanger is an old man. He\r\nis respected in the township and the district. His paper stands for all\r\nthat is solid in the valley. If that man is struck down, there will be\r\na stir through this state that will only end with our destruction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how would they bring about our destruction, Mr. Standback?\u201d cried\r\nMcGinty. \u201cIs it by the police? Sure, half of them are in our pay and\r\nhalf of them afraid of us. Or is it by the law courts and the judge?\r\nHaven\u2019t we tried that before now, and what ever came of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a Judge Lynch that might try the case,\u201d said Brother Morris.\r\n\r\nA general shout of anger greeted the suggestion.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have but to raise my finger,\u201d cried McGinty, \u201cand I could put two\r\nhundred men into this town that would clear it out from end to end.\u201d\r\nThen suddenly raising his voice and bending his huge black brows into a\r\nterrible frown, \u201cSee here, Brother Morris, I have my eye on you, and\r\nhave had for some time! You\u2019ve no heart yourself, and you try to take\r\nthe heart out of others. It will be an ill day for you, Brother Morris,\r\nwhen your own name comes on our agenda paper, and I\u2019m thinking that\r\nit\u2019s just there that I ought to place it.\u201d\r\n\r\nMorris had turned deadly pale, and his knees seemed to give way under\r\nhim as he fell back into his chair. He raised his glass in his\r\ntrembling hand and drank before he could answer. \u201cI apologize, Eminent\r\nBodymaster, to you and to every brother in this lodge if I have said\r\nmore than I should. I am a faithful member\u2014you all know that\u2014and it is\r\nmy fear lest evil come to the lodge which makes me speak in anxious\r\nwords. But I have greater trust in your judgment than in my own,\r\nEminent Bodymaster, and I promise you that I will not offend again.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Bodymaster\u2019s scowl relaxed as he listened to the humble words.\r\n\u201cVery good, Brother Morris. It\u2019s myself that would be sorry if it were\r\nneedful to give you a lesson. But so long as I am in this chair we\r\nshall be a united lodge in word and in deed. And now, boys,\u201d he\r\ncontinued, looking round at the company, \u201cI\u2019ll say this much, that if\r\nStanger got his full deserts there would be more trouble than we need\r\nask for. These editors hang together, and every journal in the state\r\nwould be crying out for police and troops. But I guess you can give him\r\na pretty severe warning. Will you fix it, Brother Baldwin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d said the young man eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow many will you take?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHalf a dozen, and two to guard the door. You\u2019ll come, Gower, and you,\r\nMansel, and you, Scanlan, and the two Willabys.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI promised the new brother he should go,\u201d said the chairman.\r\n\r\nTed Baldwin looked at McMurdo with eyes which showed that he had not\r\nforgotten nor forgiven. \u201cWell, he can come if he wants,\u201d he said in a\r\nsurly voice. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. The sooner we get to work the better.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe company broke up with shouts and yells and snatches of drunken\r\nsong. The bar was still crowded with revellers, and many of the\r\nbrethren remained there. The little band who had been told off for duty\r\npassed out into the street, proceeding in twos and threes along the\r\nsidewalk so as not to provoke attention. It was a bitterly cold night,\r\nwith a half-moon shining brilliantly in a frosty, star-spangled sky.\r\nThe men stopped and gathered in a yard which faced a high building. The\r\nwords, \u201cVermissa Herald\u201d were printed in gold lettering between the\r\nbrightly lit windows. From within came the clanking of the printing\r\npress.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere, you,\u201d said Baldwin to McMurdo, \u201cyou can stand below at the door\r\nand see that the road is kept open for us. Arthur Willaby can stay with\r\nyou. You others come with me. Have no fears, boys; for we have a dozen\r\nwitnesses that we are in the Union Bar at this very moment.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was nearly midnight, and the street was deserted save for one or two\r\nrevellers upon their way home. The party crossed the road, and, pushing\r\nopen the door of the newspaper office, Baldwin and his men rushed in\r\nand up the stair which faced them. McMurdo and another remained below.\r\nFrom the room above came a shout, a cry for help, and then the sound of\r\ntrampling feet and of falling chairs. An instant later a gray-haired\r\nman rushed out on the landing.\r\n\r\nHe was seized before he could get farther, and his spectacles came\r\ntinkling down to McMurdo\u2019s feet. There was a thud and a groan. He was\r\non his face, and half a dozen sticks were clattering together as they\r\nfell upon him. He writhed, and his long, thin limbs quivered under the\r\nblows. The others ceased at last; but Baldwin, his cruel face set in an\r\ninfernal smile, was hacking at the man\u2019s head, which he vainly\r\nendeavoured to defend with his arms. His white hair was dabbled with\r\npatches of blood. Baldwin was still stooping over his victim, putting\r\nin a short, vicious blow whenever he could see a part exposed, when\r\nMcMurdo dashed up the stair and pushed him back.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll kill the man,\u201d said he. \u201cDrop it!\u201d\r\n\r\nBaldwin looked at him in amazement. \u201cCurse you!\u201d he cried. \u201cWho are you\r\nto interfere\u2014you that are new to the lodge? Stand back!\u201d He raised his\r\nstick; but McMurdo had whipped his pistol out of his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cStand back yourself!\u201d he cried. \u201cI\u2019ll blow your face in if you lay a\r\nhand on me. As to the lodge, wasn\u2019t it the order of the Bodymaster that\r\nthe man was not to be killed\u2014and what are you doing but killing him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s truth he says,\u201d remarked one of the men.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy Gar! you\u2019d best hurry yourselves!\u201d cried the man below. \u201cThe\r\nwindows are all lighting up, and you\u2019ll have the whole town here inside\r\nof five minutes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was indeed the sound of shouting in the street, and a little\r\ngroup of compositors and pressmen was forming in the hall below and\r\nnerving itself to action. Leaving the limp and motionless body of the\r\neditor at the head of the stair, the criminals rushed down and made\r\ntheir way swiftly along the street. Having reached the Union House,\r\nsome of them mixed with the crowd in McGinty\u2019s saloon, whispering\r\nacross the bar to the Boss that the job had been well carried through.\r\nOthers, and among them McMurdo, broke away into side streets, and so by\r\ndevious paths to their own homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\nThe Valley of Fear\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen McMurdo awoke next morning he had good reason to remember his\r\ninitiation into the lodge. His head ached with the effect of the drink,\r\nand his arm, where he had been branded, was hot and swollen. Having his\r\nown peculiar source of income, he was irregular in his attendance at\r\nhis work; so he had a late breakfast, and remained at home for the\r\nmorning writing a long letter to a friend. Afterwards he read the Daily\r\nHerald. In a special column put in at the last moment he read, \u201cOutrage\r\nat the Herald Office\u2014Editor Seriously Injured.\u201d It was a short account\r\nof the facts with which he was himself more familiar than the writer\r\ncould have been. It ended with the statement:\r\n\r\nThe matter is now in the hands of the police; but it can hardly be\r\nhoped that their exertions will be attended by any better results than\r\nin the past. Some of the men were recognized, and there is hope that a\r\nconviction may be obtained. The source of the outrage was, it need\r\nhardly be said, that infamous society which has held this community in\r\nbondage for so long a period, and against which the Herald has taken so\r\nuncompromising a stand. Mr. Stanger\u2019s many friends will rejoice to hear\r\nthat, though he has been cruelly and brutally beaten, and though he has\r\nsustained severe injuries about the head, there is no immediate danger\r\nto his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow it stated that a guard of police, armed with Winchester rifles,\r\nhad been requisitioned for the defense of the office.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo had laid down the paper, and was lighting his pipe with a hand\r\nwhich was shaky from the excesses of the previous evening, when there\r\nwas a knock outside, and his landlady brought to him a note which had\r\njust been handed in by a lad. It was unsigned, and ran thus:\r\n\r\nI should wish to speak to you, but would rather not do so in your\r\nhouse. You will find me beside the flagstaff upon Miller Hill. If you\r\nwill come there now, I have something which it is important for you to\r\nhear and for me to say.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo read the note twice with the utmost surprise; for he could not\r\nimagine what it meant or who was the author of it. Had it been in a\r\nfeminine hand, he might have imagined that it was the beginning of one\r\nof those adventures which had been familiar enough in his past life.\r\nBut it was the writing of a man, and of a well educated one, too.\r\nFinally, after some hesitation, he determined to see the matter\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nMiller Hill is an ill-kept public park in the very centre of the town.\r\nIn summer it is a favourite resort of the people, but in winter it is\r\ndesolate enough. From the top of it one has a view not only of the\r\nwhole straggling, grimy town, but of the winding valley beneath, with\r\nits scattered mines and factories blackening the snow on each side of\r\nit, and of the wooded and white-capped ranges flanking it.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo strolled up the winding path hedged in with evergreens until he\r\nreached the deserted restaurant which forms the centre of summer\r\ngaiety. Beside it was a bare flagstaff, and underneath it a man, his\r\nhat drawn down and the collar of his overcoat turned up. When he turned\r\nhis face McMurdo saw that it was Brother Morris, he who had incurred\r\nthe anger of the Bodymaster the night before. The lodge sign was given\r\nand exchanged as they met.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wanted to have a word with you, Mr. McMurdo,\u201d said the older man,\r\nspeaking with a hesitation which showed that he was on delicate ground.\r\n\u201cIt was kind of you to come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you not put your name to the note?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne has to be cautious, mister. One never knows in times like these\r\nhow a thing may come back to one. One never knows either who to trust\r\nor who not to trust.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely one may trust brothers of the lodge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, not always,\u201d cried Morris with vehemence. \u201cWhatever we say,\r\neven what we think, seems to go back to that man McGinty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here!\u201d said McMurdo sternly. \u201cIt was only last night, as you know\r\nwell, that I swore good faith to our Bodymaster. Would you be asking me\r\nto break my oath?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf that is the view you take,\u201d said Morris sadly, \u201cI can only say that\r\nI am sorry I gave you the trouble to come and meet me. Things have come\r\nto a bad pass when two free citizens cannot speak their thoughts to\r\neach other.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo, who had been watching his companion very narrowly, relaxed\r\nsomewhat in his bearing. \u201cSure I spoke for myself only,\u201d said he. \u201cI am\r\na newcomer, as you know, and I am strange to it all. It is not for me\r\nto open my mouth, Mr. Morris, and if you think well to say anything to\r\nme I am here to hear it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd to take it back to Boss McGinty!\u201d said Morris bitterly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, then, you do me injustice there,\u201d cried McMurdo. \u201cFor myself I\r\nam loyal to the lodge, and so I tell you straight; but I would be a\r\npoor creature if I were to repeat to any other what you might say to me\r\nin confidence. It will go no further than me; though I warn you that\r\nyou may get neither help nor sympathy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have given up looking for either the one or the other,\u201d said Morris.\r\n\u201cI may be putting my very life in your hands by what I say; but, bad as\r\nyou are\u2014and it seemed to me last night that you were shaping to be as\r\nbad as the worst\u2014still you are new to it, and your conscience cannot\r\nyet be as hardened as theirs. That was why I thought to speak with\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what have you to say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you give me away, may a curse be on you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, I said I would not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would ask you, then, when you joined the Freeman\u2019s society in\r\nChicago and swore vows of charity and fidelity, did ever it cross your\r\nmind that you might find it would lead you to crime?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you call it crime,\u201d McMurdo answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cCall it crime!\u201d cried Morris, his voice vibrating with passion. \u201cYou\r\nhave seen little of it if you can call it anything else. Was it crime\r\nlast night when a man old enough to be your father was beaten till the\r\nblood dripped from his white hairs? Was that crime\u2014or what else would\r\nyou call it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are some would say it was war,\u201d said McMurdo, \u201ca war of two\r\nclasses with all in, so that each struck as best it could.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, did you think of such a thing when you joined the Freeman\u2019s\r\nsociety at Chicago?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m bound to say I did not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor did I when I joined it at Philadelphia. It was just a benefit club\r\nand a meeting place for one\u2019s fellows. Then I heard of this place\u2014curse\r\nthe hour that the name first fell upon my ears!\u2014and I came to better\r\nmyself! My God! to better myself! My wife and three children came with\r\nme. I started a drygoods store on Market Square, and I prospered well.\r\nThe word had gone round that I was a Freeman, and I was forced to join\r\nthe local lodge, same as you did last night. I\u2019ve the badge of shame on\r\nmy forearm and something worse branded on my heart. I found that I was\r\nunder the orders of a black villain and caught in a meshwork of crime.\r\nWhat could I do? Every word I said to make things better was taken as\r\ntreason, same as it was last night. I can\u2019t get away; for all I have in\r\nthe world is in my store. If I leave the society, I know well that it\r\nmeans murder to me, and God knows what to my wife and children. Oh,\r\nman, it is awful\u2014awful!\u201d He put his hands to his face, and his body\r\nshook with convulsive sobs.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo shrugged his shoulders. \u201cYou were too soft for the job,\u201d said\r\nhe. \u201cYou are the wrong sort for such work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI had a conscience and a religion; but they made me a criminal among\r\nthem. I was chosen for a job. If I backed down I knew well what would\r\ncome to me. Maybe I\u2019m a coward. Maybe it\u2019s the thought of my poor\r\nlittle woman and the children that makes me one. Anyhow I went. I guess\r\nit will haunt me forever.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a lonely house, twenty miles from here, over the range yonder.\r\nI was told off for the door, same as you were last night. They could\r\nnot trust me with the job. The others went in. When they came out their\r\nhands were crimson to the wrists. As we turned away a child was\r\nscreaming out of the house behind us. It was a boy of five who had seen\r\nhis father murdered. I nearly fainted with the horror of it, and yet I\r\nhad to keep a bold and smiling face; for well I knew that if I did not\r\nit would be out of my house that they would come next with their bloody\r\nhands and it would be my little Fred that would be screaming for his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I was a criminal then, part sharer in a murder, lost forever in\r\nthis world, and lost also in the next. I am a good Catholic; but the\r\npriest would have no word with me when he heard I was a Scowrer, and I\r\nam excommunicated from my faith. That\u2019s how it stands with me. And I\r\nsee you going down the same road, and I ask you what the end is to be.\r\nAre you ready to be a cold-blooded murderer also, or can we do anything\r\nto stop it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat would you do?\u201d asked McMurdo abruptly. \u201cYou would not inform?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod forbid!\u201d cried Morris. \u201cSure, the very thought would cost me my\r\nlife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s well,\u201d said McMurdo. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that you are a weak man and\r\nthat you make too much of the matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cToo much! Wait till you have lived here longer. Look down the valley!\r\nSee the cloud of a hundred chimneys that overshadows it! I tell you\r\nthat the cloud of murder hangs thicker and lower than that over the\r\nheads of the people. It is the Valley of Fear, the Valley of Death. The\r\nterror is in the hearts of the people from the dusk to the dawn. Wait,\r\nyoung man, and you will learn for yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you know what I think when I have seen more,\u201d said\r\nMcMurdo carelessly. \u201cWhat is very clear is that you are not the man for\r\nthe place, and that the sooner you sell out\u2014if you only get a dime a\r\ndollar for what the business is worth\u2014the better it will be for you.\r\nWhat you have said is safe with me; but, by Gar! if I thought you were\r\nan informer\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no!\u201d cried Morris piteously.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, let it rest at that. I\u2019ll bear what you have said in mind, and\r\nmaybe some day I\u2019ll come back to it. I expect you meant kindly by\r\nspeaking to me like this. Now I\u2019ll be getting home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne word before you go,\u201d said Morris. \u201cWe may have been seen together.\r\nThey may want to know what we have spoken about.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! that\u2019s well thought of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI offer you a clerkship in my store.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I refuse it. That\u2019s our business. Well, so long, Brother Morris,\r\nand may you find things go better with you in the future.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat same afternoon, as McMurdo sat smoking, lost in thought beside the\r\nstove of his sitting-room, the door swung open and its framework was\r\nfilled with the huge figure of Boss McGinty. He passed the sign, and\r\nthen seating himself opposite to the young man he looked at him\r\nsteadily for some time, a look which was as steadily returned.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not much of a visitor, Brother McMurdo,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI guess\r\nI am too busy over the folk that visit me. But I thought I\u2019d stretch a\r\npoint and drop down to see you in your own house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to see you here, Councillor,\u201d McMurdo answered heartily,\r\nbringing his whisky bottle out of the cupboard. \u201cIt\u2019s an honour that I\r\nhad not expected.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s the arm?\u201d asked the Boss.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo made a wry face. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not forgetting it,\u201d he said; \u201cbut\r\nit\u2019s worth it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s worth it,\u201d the other answered, \u201cto those that are loyal and\r\ngo through with it and are a help to the lodge. What were you speaking\r\nto Brother Morris about on Miller Hill this morning?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe question came so suddenly that it was well that he had his answer\r\nprepared. He burst into a hearty laugh. \u201cMorris didn\u2019t know I could\r\nearn a living here at home. He shan\u2019t know either; for he has got too\r\nmuch conscience for the likes of me. But he\u2019s a good-hearted old chap.\r\nIt was his idea that I was at a loose end, and that he would do me a\r\ngood turn by offering me a clerkship in a drygoods store.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that was it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you refused it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure. Couldn\u2019t I earn ten times as much in my own bedroom with four\r\nhours\u2019 work?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so. But I wouldn\u2019t get about too much with Morris.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I guess because I tell you not. That\u2019s enough for most folk in\r\nthese parts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may be enough for most folk; but it ain\u2019t enough for me,\r\nCouncillor,\u201d said McMurdo boldly. \u201cIf you are a judge of men, you\u2019ll\r\nknow that.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe swarthy giant glared at him, and his hairy paw closed for an\r\ninstant round the glass as though he would hurl it at the head of his\r\ncompanion. Then he laughed in his loud, boisterous, insincere fashion.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a queer card, for sure,\u201d said he. \u201cWell, if you want reasons,\r\nI\u2019ll give them. Did Morris say nothing to you against the lodge?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor against me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s because he daren\u2019t trust you. But in his heart he is not\r\na loyal brother. We know that well. So we watch him and we wait for the\r\ntime to admonish him. I\u2019m thinking that the time is drawing near.\r\nThere\u2019s no room for scabby sheep in our pen. But if you keep company\r\nwith a disloyal man, we might think that you were disloyal, too. See?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no chance of my keeping company with him; for I dislike the\r\nman,\u201d McMurdo answered. \u201cAs to being disloyal, if it was any man but\r\nyou he would not use the word to me twice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s enough,\u201d said McGinty, draining off his glass. \u201cI came\r\ndown to give you a word in season, and you\u2019ve had it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to know,\u201d said McMurdo, \u201chow you ever came to learn that I\r\nhad spoken with Morris at all?\u201d\r\n\r\nMcGinty laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s my business to know what goes on in this\r\ntownship,\u201d said he. \u201cI guess you\u2019d best reckon on my hearing all that\r\npasses. Well, time\u2019s up, and I\u2019ll just say\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nBut his leavetaking was cut short in a very unexpected fashion. With a\r\nsudden crash the door flew open, and three frowning, intent faces\r\nglared in at them from under the peaks of police caps. McMurdo sprang\r\nto his feet and half drew his revolver; but his arm stopped midway as\r\nhe became conscious that two Winchester rifles were levelled at his\r\nhead. A man in uniform advanced into the room, a six-shooter in his\r\nhand. It was Captain Marvin, once of Chicago, and now of the Mine\r\nConstabulary. He shook his head with a half-smile at McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d be getting into trouble, Mr. Crooked McMurdo of\r\nChicago,\u201d said he. \u201cCan\u2019t keep out of it, can you? Take your hat and\r\ncome along with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019ll pay for this, Captain Marvin,\u201d said McGinty. \u201cWho are\r\nyou, I\u2019d like to know, to break into a house in this fashion and molest\r\nhonest, law-abiding men?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re standing out in this deal, Councillor McGinty,\u201d said the police\r\ncaptain. \u201cWe are not out after you, but after this man McMurdo. It is\r\nfor you to help, not to hinder us in our duty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is a friend of mine, and I\u2019ll answer for his conduct,\u201d said the\r\nBoss.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy all accounts, Mr. McGinty, you may have to answer for your own\r\nconduct some of these days,\u201d the captain answered. \u201cThis man McMurdo\r\nwas a crook before ever he came here, and he\u2019s a crook still. Cover\r\nhim, Patrolman, while I disarm him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s my pistol,\u201d said McMurdo coolly. \u201cMaybe, Captain Marvin, if\r\nyou and I were alone and face to face you would not take me so easily.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your warrant?\u201d asked McGinty. \u201cBy Gar! a man might as well\r\nlive in Russia as in Vermissa while folk like you are running the\r\npolice. It\u2019s a capitalist outrage, and you\u2019ll hear more of it, I\r\nreckon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do what you think is your duty the best way you can, Councillor.\r\nWe\u2019ll look after ours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat am I accused of?\u201d asked McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf being concerned in the beating of old Editor Stanger at the Herald\r\noffice. It wasn\u2019t your fault that it isn\u2019t a murder charge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if that\u2019s all you have against him,\u201d cried McGinty with a laugh,\r\n\u201cyou can save yourself a deal of trouble by dropping it right now. This\r\nman was with me in my saloon playing poker up to midnight, and I can\r\nbring a dozen to prove it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s your affair, and I guess you can settle it in court to-morrow.\r\nMeanwhile, come on, McMurdo, and come quietly if you don\u2019t want a gun\r\nacross your head. You stand wide, Mr. McGinty; for I warn you I will\r\nstand no resistance when I am on duty!\u201d\r\n\r\nSo determined was the appearance of the captain that both McMurdo and\r\nhis boss were forced to accept the situation. The latter managed to\r\nhave a few whispered words with the prisoner before they parted.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about\u2014\u201d he jerked his thumb upward to signify the coining plant.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d whispered McMurdo, who had devised a safe hiding place\r\nunder the floor.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll bid you good-bye,\u201d said the Boss, shaking hands. \u201cI\u2019ll see Reilly\r\nthe lawyer and take the defense upon myself. Take my word for it that\r\nthey won\u2019t be able to hold you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet on that. Guard the prisoner, you two, and shoot him if\r\nhe tries any games. I\u2019ll search the house before I leave.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe did so; but apparently found no trace of the concealed plant. When\r\nhe had descended he and his men escorted McMurdo to headquarters.\r\nDarkness had fallen, and a keen blizzard was blowing so that the\r\nstreets were nearly deserted; but a few loiterers followed the group,\r\nand emboldened by invisibility shouted imprecations at the prisoner.\r\n\r\n\u201cLynch the cursed Scowrer!\u201d they cried. \u201cLynch him!\u201d They laughed and\r\njeered as he was pushed into the police station. After a short, formal\r\nexamination from the inspector in charge he was put into the common\r\ncell. Here he found Baldwin and three other criminals of the night\r\nbefore, all arrested that afternoon and waiting their trial next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nBut even within this inner fortress of the law the long arm of the\r\nFreemen was able to extend. Late at night there came a jailer with a\r\nstraw bundle for their bedding, out of which he extracted two bottles\r\nof whisky, some glasses, and a pack of cards. They spent a hilarious\r\nnight, without an anxious thought as to the ordeal of the morning.\r\n\r\nNor had they cause, as the result was to show. The magistrate could not\r\npossibly, on the evidence, have held them for a higher court. On the\r\none hand the compositors and pressmen were forced to admit that the\r\nlight was uncertain, that they were themselves much perturbed, and that\r\nit was difficult for them to swear to the identity of the assailants;\r\nalthough they believed that the accused were among them. Cross examined\r\nby the clever attorney who had been engaged by McGinty, they were even\r\nmore nebulous in their evidence.\r\n\r\nThe injured man had already deposed that he was so taken by surprise by\r\nthe suddenness of the attack that he could state nothing beyond the\r\nfact that the first man who struck him wore a moustache. He added that\r\nhe knew them to be Scowrers, since no one else in the community could\r\npossibly have any enmity to him, and he had long been threatened on\r\naccount of his outspoken editorials. On the other hand, it was clearly\r\nshown by the united and unfaltering evidence of six citizens, including\r\nthat high municipal official, Councillor McGinty, that the men had been\r\nat a card party at the Union House until an hour very much later than\r\nthe commission of the outrage.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say that they were discharged with something very near to\r\nan apology from the bench for the inconvenience to which they had been\r\nput, together with an implied censure of Captain Marvin and the police\r\nfor their officious zeal.\r\n\r\nThe verdict was greeted with loud applause by a court in which McMurdo\r\nsaw many familiar faces. Brothers of the lodge smiled and waved. But\r\nthere were others who sat with compressed lips and brooding eyes as the\r\nmen filed out of the dock. One of them, a little, dark-bearded,\r\nresolute fellow, put the thoughts of himself and comrades into words as\r\nthe ex-prisoners passed him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou damned murderers!\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll fix you yet!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\nThe Darkest Hour\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anything had been needed to give an impetus to Jack McMurdo\u2019s\r\npopularity among his fellows it would have been his arrest and\r\nacquittal. That a man on the very night of joining the lodge should\r\nhave done something which brought him before the magistrate was a new\r\nrecord in the annals of the society. Already he had earned the\r\nreputation of a good boon companion, a cheery reveller, and withal a\r\nman of high temper, who would not take an insult even from the\r\nall-powerful Boss himself. But in addition to this he impressed his\r\ncomrades with the idea that among them all there was not one whose\r\nbrain was so ready to devise a bloodthirsty scheme, or whose hand would\r\nbe more capable of carrying it out. \u201cHe\u2019ll be the boy for the clean\r\njob,\u201d said the oldsters to one another, and waited their time until\r\nthey could set him to his work.\r\n\r\nMcGinty had instruments enough already; but he recognized that this was\r\na supremely able one. He felt like a man holding a fierce bloodhound in\r\nleash. There were curs to do the smaller work; but some day he would\r\nslip this creature upon its prey. A few members of the lodge, Ted\r\nBaldwin among them, resented the rapid rise of the stranger and hated\r\nhim for it; but they kept clear of him, for he was as ready to fight as\r\nto laugh.\r\n\r\nBut if he gained favour with his fellows, there was another quarter,\r\none which had become even more vital to him, in which he lost it. Ettie\r\nShafter\u2019s father would have nothing more to do with him, nor would he\r\nallow him to enter the house. Ettie herself was too deeply in love to\r\ngive him up altogether, and yet her own good sense warned her of what\r\nwould come from a marriage with a man who was regarded as a criminal.\r\n\r\nOne morning after a sleepless night she determined to see him, possibly\r\nfor the last time, and make one strong endeavour to draw him from those\r\nevil influences which were sucking him down. She went to his house, as\r\nhe had often begged her to do, and made her way into the room which he\r\nused as his sitting-room. He was seated at a table, with his back\r\nturned and a letter in front of him. A sudden spirit of girlish\r\nmischief came over her\u2014she was still only nineteen. He had not heard\r\nher when she pushed open the door. Now she tiptoed forward and laid her\r\nhand lightly upon his bended shoulders.\r\n\r\nIf she had expected to startle him, she certainly succeeded; but only\r\nin turn to be startled herself. With a tiger spring he turned on her,\r\nand his right hand was feeling for her throat. At the same instant with\r\nthe other hand he crumpled up the paper that lay before him. For an\r\ninstant he stood glaring. Then astonishment and joy took the place of\r\nthe ferocity which had convulsed his features\u2014a ferocity which had sent\r\nher shrinking back in horror as from something which had never before\r\nintruded into her gentle life.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d said he, mopping his brow. \u201cAnd to think that you should\r\ncome to me, heart of my heart, and I should find nothing better to do\r\nthan to want to strangle you! Come then, darling,\u201d and he held out his\r\narms, \u201clet me make it up to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut she had not recovered from that sudden glimpse of guilty fear which\r\nshe had read in the man\u2019s face. All her woman\u2019s instinct told her that\r\nit was not the mere fright of a man who is startled. Guilt\u2014that was\r\nit\u2014guilt and fear!\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s come over you, Jack?\u201d she cried. \u201cWhy were you so scared of me?\r\nOh, Jack, if your conscience was at ease, you would not have looked at\r\nme like that!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, I was thinking of other things, and when you came tripping so\r\nlightly on those fairy feet of yours\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, it was more than that, Jack.\u201d Then a sudden suspicion seized\r\nher. \u201cLet me see that letter you were writing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, Ettie, I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer suspicions became certainties. \u201cIt\u2019s to another woman,\u201d she cried.\r\n\u201cI know it! Why else should you hold it from me? Was it to your wife\r\nthat you were writing? How am I to know that you are not a married\r\nman\u2014you, a stranger, that nobody knows?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not married, Ettie. See now, I swear it! You\u2019re the only one\r\nwoman on earth to me. By the cross of Christ I swear it!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was so white with passionate earnestness that she could not but\r\nbelieve him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d she cried, \u201cwhy will you not show me the letter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, acushla,\u201d said he. \u201cI\u2019m under oath not to show it, and\r\njust as I wouldn\u2019t break my word to you so I would keep it to those who\r\nhold my promise. It\u2019s the business of the lodge, and even to you it\u2019s\r\nsecret. And if I was scared when a hand fell on me, can\u2019t you\r\nunderstand it when it might have been the hand of a detective?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe felt that he was telling the truth. He gathered her into his arms\r\nand kissed away her fears and doubts.\r\n\r\n\u201cSit here by me, then. It\u2019s a queer throne for such a queen; but it\u2019s\r\nthe best your poor lover can find. He\u2019ll do better for you some of\r\nthese days, I\u2019m thinking. Now your mind is easy once again, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can it ever be at ease, Jack, when I know that you are a criminal\r\namong criminals, when I never know the day that I may hear you are in\r\ncourt for murder? \u2018McMurdo the Scowrer,\u2019 that\u2019s what one of our\r\nboarders called you yesterday. It went through my heart like a knife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, hard words break no bones.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut they were true.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, dear, it\u2019s not so bad as you think. We are but poor men that are\r\ntrying in our own way to get our rights.\u201d\r\n\r\nEttie threw her arms round her lover\u2019s neck. \u201cGive it up, Jack! For my\r\nsake, for God\u2019s sake, give it up! It was to ask you that I came here\r\nto-day. Oh, Jack, see\u2014I beg it of you on my bended knees! Kneeling here\r\nbefore you I implore you to give it up!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \u201cOh, Jack, I implore you to give it up!\u201d]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe raised her and soothed her with her head against his breast.\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, my darlin\u2019, you don\u2019t know what it is you are asking. How could\r\nI give it up when it would be to break my oath and to desert my\r\ncomrades? If you could see how things stand with me you could never ask\r\nit of me. Besides, if I wanted to, how could I do it? You don\u2019t suppose\r\nthat the lodge would let a man go free with all its secrets?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought of that, Jack. I\u2019ve planned it all. Father has saved some\r\nmoney. He is weary of this place where the fear of these people darkens\r\nour lives. He is ready to go. We would fly together to Philadelphia or\r\nNew York, where we would be safe from them.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo laughed. \u201cThe lodge has a long arm. Do you think it could not\r\nstretch from here to Philadelphia or New York?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, to the West, or to England, or to Germany, where father\r\ncame from\u2014anywhere to get away from this Valley of Fear!\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo thought of old Brother Morris. \u201cSure, it is the second time I\r\nhave heard the valley so named,\u201d said he. \u201cThe shadow does indeed seem\r\nto lie heavy on some of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt darkens every moment of our lives. Do you suppose that Ted Baldwin\r\nhas ever forgiven us? If it were not that he fears you, what do you\r\nsuppose our chances would be? If you saw the look in those dark, hungry\r\neyes of his when they fall on me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy Gar! I\u2019d teach him better manners if I caught him at it! But see\r\nhere, little girl. I can\u2019t leave here. I can\u2019t\u2014take that from me once\r\nand for all. But if you will leave me to find my own way, I will try to\r\nprepare a way of getting honourably out of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no honour in such a matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well, it\u2019s just how you look at it. But if you\u2019ll give me six\r\nmonths, I\u2019ll work it so that I can leave without being ashamed to look\r\nothers in the face.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed with joy. \u201cSix months!\u201d she cried. \u201cIs it a promise?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it may be seven or eight. But within a year at the furthest we\r\nwill leave the valley behind us.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was the most that Ettie could obtain, and yet it was something.\r\nThere was this distant light to illuminate the gloom of the immediate\r\nfuture. She returned to her father\u2019s house more light-hearted than she\r\nhad ever been since Jack McMurdo had come into her life.\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that as a member, all the doings of the society\r\nwould be told to him; but he was soon to discover that the organization\r\nwas wider and more complex than the simple lodge. Even Boss McGinty was\r\nignorant as to many things; for there was an official named the County\r\nDelegate, living at Hobson\u2019s Patch farther down the line, who had power\r\nover several different lodges which he wielded in a sudden and\r\narbitrary way. Only once did McMurdo see him, a sly, little gray-haired\r\nrat of a man, with a slinking gait and a sidelong glance which was\r\ncharged with malice. Evans Pott was his name, and even the great Boss\r\nof Vermissa felt towards him something of the repulsion and fear which\r\nthe huge Danton may have felt for the puny but dangerous Robespierre.\r\n\r\nOne day Scanlan, who was McMurdo\u2019s fellow boarder, received a note from\r\nMcGinty inclosing one from Evans Pott, which informed him that he was\r\nsending over two good men, Lawler and Andrews, who had instructions to\r\nact in the neighbourhood; though it was best for the cause that no\r\nparticulars as to their objects should be given. Would the Bodymaster\r\nsee to it that suitable arrangements be made for their lodgings and\r\ncomfort until the time for action should arrive? McGinty added that it\r\nwas impossible for anyone to remain secret at the Union House, and\r\nthat, therefore, he would be obliged if McMurdo and Scanlan would put\r\nthe strangers up for a few days in their boarding house.\r\n\r\nThe same evening the two men arrived, each carrying his gripsack.\r\nLawler was an elderly man, shrewd, silent, and self-contained, clad in\r\nan old black frock coat, which with his soft felt hat and ragged,\r\ngrizzled beard gave him a general resemblance to an itinerant preacher.\r\nHis companion Andrews was little more than a boy, frank-faced and\r\ncheerful, with the breezy manner of one who is out for a holiday and\r\nmeans to enjoy every minute of it. Both men were total abstainers, and\r\nbehaved in all ways as exemplary members of the society, with the one\r\nsimple exception that they were assassins who had often proved\r\nthemselves to be most capable instruments for this association of\r\nmurder. Lawler had already carried out fourteen commissions of the\r\nkind, and Andrews three.\r\n\r\nThey were, as McMurdo found, quite ready to converse about their deeds\r\nin the past, which they recounted with the half-bashful pride of men\r\nwho had done good and unselfish service for the community. They were\r\nreticent, however, as to the immediate job in hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey chose us because neither I nor the boy here drink,\u201d Lawler\r\nexplained. \u201cThey can count on us saying no more than we should. You\r\nmust not take it amiss, but it is the orders of the County Delegate\r\nthat we obey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, we are all in it together,\u201d said Scanlan, McMurdo\u2019s mate, as the\r\nfour sat together at supper.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true enough, and we\u2019ll talk till the cows come home of the\r\nkilling of Charlie Williams or of Simon Bird, or any other job in the\r\npast. But till the work is done we say nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are half a dozen about here that I have a word to say to,\u201d said\r\nMcMurdo, with an oath. \u201cI suppose it isn\u2019t Jack Knox of Ironhill that\r\nyou are after. I\u2019d go some way to see him get his deserts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not him yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr Herman Strauss?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, nor him either.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if you won\u2019t tell us we can\u2019t make you; but I\u2019d be glad to\r\nknow.\u201d\r\n\r\nLawler smiled and shook his head. He was not to be drawn.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the reticence of their guests, Scanlan and McMurdo were\r\nquite determined to be present at what they called \u201cthe fun.\u201d When,\r\ntherefore, at an early hour one morning McMurdo heard them creeping\r\ndown the stairs he awakened Scanlan, and the two hurried on their\r\nclothes. When they were dressed they found that the others had stolen\r\nout, leaving the door open behind them. It was not yet dawn, and by the\r\nlight of the lamps they could see the two men some distance down the\r\nstreet. They followed them warily, treading noiselessly in the deep\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nThe boarding house was near the edge of the town, and soon they were at\r\nthe crossroads which is beyond its boundary. Here three men were\r\nwaiting, with whom Lawler and Andrews held a short, eager conversation.\r\nThen they all moved on together. It was clearly some notable job which\r\nneeded numbers. At this point there are several trails which lead to\r\nvarious mines. The strangers took that which led to the Crow Hill, a\r\nhuge business which was in strong hands which had been able, thanks to\r\ntheir energetic and fearless New England manager, Josiah H. Dunn, to\r\nkeep some order and discipline during the long reign of terror.\r\n\r\nDay was breaking now, and a line of workmen were slowly making their\r\nway, singly and in groups, along the blackened path.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo and Scanlan strolled on with the others, keeping in sight of\r\nthe men whom they followed. A thick mist lay over them, and from the\r\nheart of it there came the sudden scream of a steam whistle. It was the\r\nten-minute signal before the cages descended and the day\u2019s labour\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the open space round the mine shaft there were a\r\nhundred miners waiting, stamping their feet and blowing on their\r\nfingers; for it was bitterly cold. The strangers stood in a little\r\ngroup under the shadow of the engine house. Scanlan and McMurdo climbed\r\na heap of slag from which the whole scene lay before them. They saw the\r\nmine engineer, a great bearded Scotchman named Menzies, come out of the\r\nengine house and blow his whistle for the cages to be lowered.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant a tall, loose-framed young man with a clean-shaved,\r\nearnest face advanced eagerly towards the pit head. As he came forward\r\nhis eyes fell upon the group, silent and motionless, under the engine\r\nhouse. The men had drawn down their hats and turned up their collars to\r\nscreen their faces. For a moment the presentiment of Death laid its\r\ncold hand upon the manager\u2019s heart. At the next he had shaken it off\r\nand saw only his duty towards intrusive strangers.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked as he advanced. \u201cWhat are you loitering there\r\nfor?\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no answer; but the lad Andrews stepped forward and shot him\r\nin the stomach. The hundred waiting miners stood as motionless and\r\nhelpless as if they were paralyzed. The manager clapped his two hands\r\nto the wound and doubled himself up. Then he staggered away; but\r\nanother of the assassins fired, and he went down sidewise, kicking and\r\nclawing among a heap of clinkers. Menzies, the Scotchman, gave a roar\r\nof rage at the sight and rushed with an iron spanner at the murderers;\r\nbut was met by two balls in the face which dropped him dead at their\r\nvery feet.\r\n\r\nThere was a surge forward of some of the miners, and an inarticulate\r\ncry of pity and of anger; but a couple of the strangers emptied their\r\nsix-shooters over the heads of the crowd, and they broke and scattered,\r\nsome of them rushing wildly back to their homes in Vermissa.\r\n\r\nWhen a few of the bravest had rallied, and there was a return to the\r\nmine, the murderous gang had vanished in the mists of morning, without\r\na single witness being able to swear to the identity of these men who\r\nin front of a hundred spectators had wrought this double crime.\r\n\r\nScanlan and McMurdo made their way back; Scanlan somewhat subdued, for\r\nit was the first murder job that he had seen with his own eyes, and it\r\nappeared less funny than he had been led to believe. The horrible\r\nscreams of the dead manager\u2019s wife pursued them as they hurried to the\r\ntown. McMurdo was absorbed and silent; but he showed no sympathy for\r\nthe weakening of his companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, it is like a war,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhat is it but a war between us\r\nand them, and we hit back where we best can.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was high revel in the lodge room at the Union House that night,\r\nnot only over the killing of the manager and engineer of the Crow Hill\r\nmine, which would bring this organization into line with the other\r\nblackmailed and terror-stricken companies of the district, but also\r\nover a distant triumph which had been wrought by the hands of the lodge\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that when the County Delegate had sent over five good\r\nmen to strike a blow in Vermissa, he had demanded that in return three\r\nVermissa men should be secretly selected and sent across to kill\r\nWilliam Hales of Stake Royal, one of the best known and most popular\r\nmine owners in the Gilmerton district, a man who was believed not to\r\nhave an enemy in the world; for he was in all ways a model employer. He\r\nhad insisted, however, upon efficiency in the work, and had, therefore,\r\npaid off certain drunken and idle employees who were members of the\r\nall-powerful society. Coffin notices hung outside his door had not\r\nweakened his resolution, and so in a free, civilized country he found\r\nhimself condemned to death.\r\n\r\nThe execution had now been duly carried out. Ted Baldwin, who sprawled\r\nnow in the seat of honour beside the Bodymaster, had been chief of the\r\nparty. His flushed face and glazed, bloodshot eyes told of\r\nsleeplessness and drink. He and his two comrades had spent the night\r\nbefore among the mountains. They were unkempt and weather-stained. But\r\nno heroes, returning from a forlorn hope, could have had a warmer\r\nwelcome from their comrades.\r\n\r\nThe story was told and retold amid cries of delight and shouts of\r\nlaughter. They had waited for their man as he drove home at nightfall,\r\ntaking their station at the top of a steep hill, where his horse must\r\nbe at a walk. He was so furred to keep out the cold that he could not\r\nlay his hand on his pistol. They had pulled him out and shot him again\r\nand again. He had screamed for mercy. The screams were repeated for the\r\namusement of the lodge.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s hear again how he squealed,\u201d they cried.\r\n\r\nNone of them knew the man; but there is eternal drama in a killing, and\r\nthey had shown the Scowrers of Gilmerton that the Vermissa men were to\r\nbe relied upon.\r\n\r\nThere had been one contretemps; for a man and his wife had driven up\r\nwhile they were still emptying their revolvers into the silent body. It\r\nhad been suggested that they should shoot them both; but they were\r\nharmless folk who were not connected with the mines, so they were\r\nsternly bidden to drive on and keep silent, lest a worse thing befall\r\nthem. And so the blood-mottled figure had been left as a warning to all\r\nsuch hard-hearted employers, and the three noble avengers had hurried\r\noff into the mountains where unbroken nature comes down to the very\r\nedge of the furnaces and the slag heaps. Here they were, safe and\r\nsound, their work well done, and the plaudits of their companions in\r\ntheir ears.\r\n\r\nIt had been a great day for the Scowrers. The shadow had fallen even\r\ndarker over the valley. But as the wise general chooses the moment of\r\nvictory in which to redouble his efforts, so that his foes may have no\r\ntime to steady themselves after disaster, so Boss McGinty, looking out\r\nupon the scene of his operations with his brooding and malicious eyes,\r\nhad devised a new attack upon those who opposed him. That very night,\r\nas the half-drunken company broke up, he touched McMurdo on the arm and\r\nled him aside into that inner room where they had their first\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here, my lad,\u201d said he, \u201cI\u2019ve got a job that\u2019s worthy of you at\r\nlast. You\u2019ll have the doing of it in your own hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cProud I am to hear it,\u201d McMurdo answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can take two men with you\u2014Manders and Reilly. They have been\r\nwarned for service. We\u2019ll never be right in this district until Chester\r\nWilcox has been settled, and you\u2019ll have the thanks of every lodge in\r\nthe coal fields if you can down him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best, anyhow. Who is he, and where shall I find him?\u201d\r\n\r\nMcGinty took his eternal half-chewed, half-smoked cigar from the corner\r\nof his mouth, and proceeded to draw a rough diagram on a page torn from\r\nhis notebook.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s the chief foreman of the Iron Dike Company. He\u2019s a hard citizen,\r\nan old colour sergeant of the war, all scars and grizzle. We\u2019ve had two\r\ntries at him; but had no luck, and Jim Carnaway lost his life over it.\r\nNow it\u2019s for you to take it over. That\u2019s the house\u2014all alone at the\r\nIron Dike crossroad, same as you see here on the map\u2014without another\r\nwithin earshot. It\u2019s no good by day. He\u2019s armed and shoots quick and\r\nstraight, with no questions asked. But at night\u2014well, there he is with\r\nhis wife, three children, and a hired help. You can\u2019t pick or choose.\r\nIt\u2019s all or none. If you could get a bag of blasting powder at the\r\nfront door with a slow match to it\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the man done?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you he shot Jim Carnaway?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did he shoot him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat in thunder has that to do with you? Carnaway was about his house\r\nat night, and he shot him. That\u2019s enough for me and you. You\u2019ve got to\r\nsettle the thing right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s these two women and the children. Do they go up too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have to\u2014else how can we get him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems hard on them; for they\u2019ve done nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat sort of fool\u2019s talk is this? Do you back out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEasy, Councillor, easy! What have I ever said or done that you should\r\nthink I would be after standing back from an order of the Bodymaster of\r\nmy own lodge? If it\u2019s right or if it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s for you to decide.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I will do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you had best give me a night or two that I may see the house and\r\nmake my plans. Then\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said McGinty, shaking him by the hand. \u201cI leave it with\r\nyou. It will be a great day when you bring us the news. It\u2019s just the\r\nlast stroke that will bring them all to their knees.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo thought long and deeply over the commission which had been so\r\nsuddenly placed in his hands. The isolated house in which Chester\r\nWilcox lived was about five miles off in an adjacent valley. That very\r\nnight he started off all alone to prepare for the attempt. It was\r\ndaylight before he returned from his reconnaissance. Next day he\r\ninterviewed his two subordinates, Manders and Reilly, reckless\r\nyoungsters who were as elated as if it were a deer-hunt.\r\n\r\nTwo nights later they met outside the town, all three armed, and one of\r\nthem carrying a sack stuffed with the powder which was used in the\r\nquarries. It was two in the morning before they came to the lonely\r\nhouse. The night was a windy one, with broken clouds drifting swiftly\r\nacross the face of a three-quarter moon. They had been warned to be on\r\ntheir guard against bloodhounds; so they moved forward cautiously, with\r\ntheir pistols cocked in their hands. But there was no sound save the\r\nhowling of the wind, and no movement but the swaying branches above\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo listened at the door of the lonely house; but all was still\r\nwithin. Then he leaned the powder bag against it, ripped a hole in it\r\nwith his knife, and attached the fuse. When it was well alight he and\r\nhis two companions took to their heels, and were some distance off,\r\nsafe and snug in a sheltering ditch, before the shattering roar of the\r\nexplosion, with the low, deep rumble of the collapsing building, told\r\nthem that their work was done. No cleaner job had ever been carried out\r\nin the bloodstained annals of the society.\r\n\r\nBut alas that work so well organized and boldly carried out should all\r\nhave gone for nothing! Warned by the fate of the various victims, and\r\nknowing that he was marked down for destruction, Chester Wilcox had\r\nmoved himself and his family only the day before to some safer and less\r\nknown quarters, where a guard of police should watch over them. It was\r\nan empty house which had been torn down by the gunpowder, and the grim\r\nold colour sergeant of the war was still teaching discipline to the\r\nminers of Iron Dike.\r\n\r\n\u201cLeave him to me,\u201d said McMurdo. \u201cHe\u2019s my man, and I\u2019ll get him sure if\r\nI have to wait a year for him.\u201d\r\n\r\nA vote of thanks and confidence was passed in full lodge, and so for\r\nthe time the matter ended. When a few weeks later it was reported in\r\nthe papers that Wilcox had been shot at from an ambuscade, it was an\r\nopen secret that McMurdo was still at work upon his unfinished job.\r\n\r\nSuch were the methods of the Society of Freemen, and such were the\r\ndeeds of the Scowrers by which they spread their rule of fear over the\r\ngreat and rich district which was for so long a period haunted by their\r\nterrible presence. Why should these pages be stained by further crimes?\r\nHave I not said enough to show the men and their methods?\r\n\r\nThese deeds are written in history, and there are records wherein one\r\nmay read the details of them. There one may learn of the shooting of\r\nPolicemen Hunt and Evans because they had ventured to arrest two\r\nmembers of the society\u2014a double outrage planned at the Vermissa lodge\r\nand carried out in cold blood upon two helpless and disarmed men. There\r\nalso one may read of the shooting of Mrs. Larbey when she was nursing\r\nher husband, who had been beaten almost to death by orders of Boss\r\nMcGinty. The killing of the elder Jenkins, shortly followed by that of\r\nhis brother, the mutilation of James Murdoch, the blowing up of the\r\nStaphouse family, and the murder of the Stendals all followed hard upon\r\none another in the same terrible winter.\r\n\r\nDarkly the shadow lay upon the Valley of Fear. The spring had come with\r\nrunning brooks and blossoming trees. There was hope for all Nature\r\nbound so long in an iron grip; but nowhere was there any hope for the\r\nmen and women who lived under the yoke of the terror. Never had the\r\ncloud above them been so dark and hopeless as in the early summer of\r\nthe year 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\nDanger\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the height of the reign of terror. McMurdo, who had already been\r\nappointed Inner Deacon, with every prospect of some day succeeding\r\nMcGinty as Bodymaster, was now so necessary to the councils of his\r\ncomrades that nothing was done without his help and advice. The more\r\npopular he became, however, with the Freemen, the blacker were the\r\nscowls which greeted him as he passed along the streets of Vermissa. In\r\nspite of their terror the citizens were taking heart to band themselves\r\ntogether against their oppressors. Rumours had reached the lodge of\r\nsecret gatherings in the Herald office and of distribution of firearms\r\namong the law-abiding people. But McGinty and his men were undisturbed\r\nby such reports. They were numerous, resolute, and well armed. Their\r\nopponents were scattered and powerless. It would all end, as it had\r\ndone in the past, in aimless talk and possibly in impotent arrests. So\r\nsaid McGinty, McMurdo, and all the bolder spirits.\r\n\r\nIt was a Saturday evening in May. Saturday was always the lodge night,\r\nand McMurdo was leaving his house to attend it when Morris, the weaker\r\nbrother of the order, came to see him. His brow was creased with care,\r\nand his kindly face was drawn and haggard.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan I speak with you freely, Mr. McMurdo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t forget that I spoke my heart to you once, and that you kept it\r\nto yourself, even though the Boss himself came to ask you about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat else could I do if you trusted me? It wasn\u2019t that I agreed with\r\nwhat you said.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know that well. But you are the one that I can speak to and be safe.\r\nI\u2019ve a secret here,\u201d he put his hand to his breast, \u201cand it is just\r\nburning the life out of me. I wish it had come to any one of you but\r\nme. If I tell it, it will mean murder, for sure. If I don\u2019t, it may\r\nbring the end of us all. God help me, but I am near out of my wits over\r\nit!\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo looked at the man earnestly. He was trembling in every limb. He\r\npoured some whisky into a glass and handed it to him. \u201cThat\u2019s the\r\nphysic for the likes of you,\u201d said he. \u201cNow let me hear of it.\u201d\r\n\r\nMorris drank, and his white face took a tinge of colour. \u201cI can tell it\r\nto you all in one sentence,\u201d said he. \u201cThere\u2019s a detective on our\r\ntrail.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo stared at him in astonishment. \u201cWhy, man, you\u2019re crazy,\u201d he\r\nsaid. \u201cIsn\u2019t the place full of police and detectives and what harm did\r\nthey ever do us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s no man of the district. As you say, we know them, and it\r\nis little that they can do. But you\u2019ve heard of Pinkerton\u2019s?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve read of some folk of that name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can take it from me you\u2019ve no show when they are on your\r\ntrail. It\u2019s not a take-it-or-miss-it government concern. It\u2019s a dead\r\nearnest business proposition that\u2019s out for results and keeps out till\r\nby hook or crook it gets them. If a Pinkerton man is deep in this\r\nbusiness, we are all destroyed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must kill him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s the first thought that came to you! So it will be up at the\r\nlodge. Didn\u2019t I say to you that it would end in murder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, what is murder? Isn\u2019t it common enough in these parts?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, indeed; but it\u2019s not for me to point out the man that is to be\r\nmurdered. I\u2019d never rest easy again. And yet it\u2019s our own necks that\r\nmay be at stake. In God\u2019s name what shall I do?\u201d He rocked to and fro\r\nin his agony of indecision.\r\n\r\nBut his words had moved McMurdo deeply. It was easy to see that he\r\nshared the other\u2019s opinion as to the danger, and the need for meeting\r\nit. He gripped Morris\u2019s shoulder and shook him in his earnestness.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here, man,\u201d he cried, and he almost screeched the words in his\r\nexcitement, \u201cyou won\u2019t gain anything by sitting keening like an old\r\nwife at a wake. Let\u2019s have the facts. Who is the fellow? Where is he?\r\nHow did you hear of him? Why did you come to me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI came to you; for you are the one man that would advise me. I told\r\nyou that I had a store in the East before I came here. I left good\r\nfriends behind me, and one of them is in the telegraph service. Here\u2019s\r\na letter that I had from him yesterday. It\u2019s this part from the top of\r\nthe page. You can read it yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was what McMurdo read:\r\n\r\nHow are the Scowrers getting on in your parts? We read plenty of them\r\nin the papers. Between you and me I expect to hear news from you before\r\nlong. Five big corporations and the two railroads have taken the thing\r\nup in dead earnest. They mean it, and you can bet they\u2019ll get there!\r\nThey are right deep down into it. Pinkerton has taken hold under their\r\norders, and his best man, Birdy Edwards, is operating. The thing has\r\ngot to be stopped right now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNow read the postscript.\u201d\r\n\r\nOf course, what I give you is what I learned in business; so it goes no\r\nfurther. It\u2019s a queer cipher that you handle by the yard every day and\r\ncan get no meaning from.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcMurdo sat in silence for some time, with the letter in his listless\r\nhands. The mist had lifted for a moment, and there was the abyss before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes anyone else know of this?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have told no one else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut this man\u2014your friend\u2014has he any other person that he would be\r\nlikely to write to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I dare say he knows one or two more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf the lodge?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was asking because it is likely that he may have given some\r\ndescription of this fellow Birdy Edwards\u2014then we could get on his\r\ntrail.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s possible. But I should not think he knew him. He is just\r\ntelling me the news that came to him by way of business. How would he\r\nknow this Pinkerton man?\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo gave a violent start.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy Gar!\u201d he cried, \u201cI\u2019ve got him. What a fool I was not to know it.\r\nLord! but we\u2019re in luck! We will fix him before he can do any harm. See\r\nhere, Morris, will you leave this thing in my hands?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, if you will only take it off mine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do that. You can stand right back and let me run it. Even your\r\nname need not be mentioned. I\u2019ll take it all on myself, as if it were\r\nto me that this letter has come. Will that content you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just what I would ask.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen leave it at that and keep your head shut. Now I\u2019ll get down to\r\nthe lodge, and we\u2019ll soon make old man Pinkerton sorry for himself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t kill this man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe less you know, Friend Morris, the easier your conscience will be,\r\nand the better you will sleep. Ask no questions, and let these things\r\nsettle themselves. I have hold of it now.\u201d\r\n\r\nMorris shook his head sadly as he left. \u201cI feel that his blood is on my\r\nhands,\u201d he groaned.\r\n\r\n\u201cSelf-protection is no murder, anyhow,\u201d said McMurdo, smiling grimly.\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s him or us. I guess this man would destroy us all if we left him\r\nlong in the valley. Why, Brother Morris, we\u2019ll have to elect you\r\nBodymaster yet; for you\u2019ve surely saved the lodge.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was clear from his actions that he thought more seriously of\r\nthis new intrusion than his words would show. It may have been his\r\nguilty conscience, it may have been the reputation of the Pinkerton\r\norganization, it may have been the knowledge that great, rich\r\ncorporations had set themselves the task of clearing out the Scowrers;\r\nbut, whatever his reason, his actions were those of a man who is\r\npreparing for the worst. Every paper which would incriminate him was\r\ndestroyed before he left the house. After that he gave a long sigh of\r\nsatisfaction; for it seemed to him that he was safe. And yet the danger\r\nmust still have pressed somewhat upon him; for on his way to the lodge\r\nhe stopped at old man Shafter\u2019s. The house was forbidden him; but when\r\nhe tapped at the window Ettie came out to him. The dancing Irish\r\ndeviltry had gone from her lover\u2019s eyes. She read his danger in his\r\nearnest face.\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething has happened!\u201d she cried. \u201cOh, Jack, you are in danger!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, it is not very bad, my sweetheart. And yet it may be wise that\r\nwe make a move before it is worse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMake a move?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI promised you once that I would go some day. I think the time is\r\ncoming. I had news to-night, bad news, and I see trouble coming.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe police?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, a Pinkerton. But, sure, you wouldn\u2019t know what that is, acushla,\r\nnor what it may mean to the likes of me. I\u2019m too deep in this thing,\r\nand I may have to get out of it quick. You said you would come with me\r\nif I went.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Jack, it would be the saving of you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m an honest man in some things, Ettie. I wouldn\u2019t hurt a hair of\r\nyour bonny head for all that the world can give, nor ever pull you down\r\none inch from the golden throne above the clouds where I always see\r\nyou. Would you trust me?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe put her hand in his without a word. \u201cWell, then, listen to what I\r\nsay, and do as I order you, for indeed it\u2019s the only way for us. Things\r\nare going to happen in this valley. I feel it in my bones. There may be\r\nmany of us that will have to look out for ourselves. I\u2019m one, anyhow.\r\nIf I go, by day or night, it\u2019s you that must come with me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d come after you, Jack.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, you shall come _with_ me. If this valley is closed to me and I\r\ncan never come back, how can I leave you behind, and me perhaps in\r\nhiding from the police with never a chance of a message? It\u2019s with me\r\nyou must come. I know a good woman in the place I come from, and it\u2019s\r\nthere I\u2019d leave you till we can get married. Will you come?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Jack, I will come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod bless you for your trust in me! It\u2019s a fiend out of hell that I\r\nshould be if I abused it. Now, mark you, Ettie, it will be just a word\r\nto you, and when it reaches you, you will drop everything and come\r\nright down to the waiting room at the depot and stay there till I come\r\nfor you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDay or night, I\u2019ll come at the word, Jack.\u201d\r\n\r\nSomewhat eased in mind, now that his own preparations for escape had\r\nbeen begun, McMurdo went on to the lodge. It had already assembled, and\r\nonly by complicated signs and countersigns could he pass through the\r\nouter guard and inner guard who close-tiled it. A buzz of pleasure and\r\nwelcome greeted him as he entered. The long room was crowded, and\r\nthrough the haze of tobacco smoke he saw the tangled black mane of the\r\nBodymaster, the cruel, unfriendly features of Baldwin, the vulture face\r\nof Harraway, the secretary, and a dozen more who were among the leaders\r\nof the lodge. He rejoiced that they should all be there to take counsel\r\nover his news.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, it\u2019s glad we are to see you, Brother!\u201d cried the chairman.\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s business here that wants a Solomon in judgment to set it\r\nright.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Lander and Egan,\u201d explained his neighbour as he took his seat.\r\n\u201cThey both claim the head money given by the lodge for the shooting of\r\nold man Crabbe over at Stylestown, and who\u2019s to say which fired the\r\nbullet?\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo rose in his place and raised his hand. The expression of his\r\nface froze the attention of the audience. There was a dead hush of\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\n\u201cEminent Bodymaster,\u201d he said, in a solemn voice, \u201cI claim urgency!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBrother McMurdo claims urgency,\u201d said McGinty. \u201cIt\u2019s a claim that by\r\nthe rules of this lodge takes precedence. Now Brother, we attend you.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo took the letter from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cEminent Bodymaster and Brethren,\u201d he said, \u201cI am the bearer of ill\r\nnews this day; but it is better that it should be known and discussed,\r\nthan that a blow should fall upon us without warning which would\r\ndestroy us all. I have information that the most powerful and richest\r\norganizations in this state have bound themselves together for our\r\ndestruction, and that at this very moment there is a Pinkerton\r\ndetective, one Birdy Edwards, at work in the valley collecting the\r\nevidence which may put a rope round the necks of many of us, and send\r\nevery man in this room into a felon\u2019s cell. That is the situation for\r\nthe discussion of which I have made a claim of urgency.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence in the room. It was broken by the chairman.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is your evidence for this, Brother McMurdo?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is in this letter which has come into my hands,\u201d said McMurdo. He\r\nread the passage aloud. \u201cIt is a matter of honour with me that I can\r\ngive no further particulars about the letter, nor put it into your\r\nhands; but I assure you that there is nothing else in it which can\r\naffect the interests of the lodge. I put the case before you as it has\r\nreached me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me say, Mr. Chairman,\u201d said one of the older brethren, \u201cthat I\r\nhave heard of Birdy Edwards, and that he has the name of being the best\r\nman in the Pinkerton service.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes anyone know him by sight?\u201d asked McGinty.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said McMurdo, \u201cI do.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of astonishment through the hall.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe we hold him in the hollow of our hands,\u201d he continued with\r\nan exulting smile upon his face. \u201cIf we act quickly and wisely, we can\r\ncut this thing short. If I have your confidence and your help, it is\r\nlittle that we have to fear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have we to fear, anyhow? What can he know of our affairs?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou might say so if all were as stanch as you, Councillor. But this\r\nman has all the millions of the capitalists at his back. Do you think\r\nthere is no weaker brother among all our lodges that could not be\r\nbought? He will get at our secrets\u2014maybe has got them already. There\u2019s\r\nonly one sure cure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat he never leaves the valley,\u201d said Baldwin.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo nodded. \u201cGood for you, Brother Baldwin,\u201d he said. \u201cYou and I\r\nhave had our differences, but you have said the true word to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is he, then? Where shall we know him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEminent Bodymaster,\u201d said McMurdo, earnestly, \u201cI would put it to you\r\nthat this is too vital a thing for us to discuss in open lodge. God\r\nforbid that I should throw a doubt on anyone here; but if so much as a\r\nword of gossip got to the ears of this man, there would be an end of\r\nany chance of our getting him. I would ask the lodge to choose a trusty\r\ncommittee, Mr. Chairman\u2014yourself, if I might suggest it, and Brother\r\nBaldwin here, and five more. Then I can talk freely of what I know and\r\nof what I advise should be done.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe proposition was at once adopted, and the committee chosen. Besides\r\nthe chairman and Baldwin there were the vulture-faced secretary,\r\nHarraway, Tiger Cormac, the brutal young assassin, Carter, the\r\ntreasurer, and the brothers Willaby, fearless and desperate men who\r\nwould stick at nothing.\r\n\r\nThe usual revelry of the lodge was short and subdued: for there was a\r\ncloud upon the men\u2019s spirits, and many there for the first time began\r\nto see the cloud of avenging Law drifting up in that serene sky under\r\nwhich they had dwelt so long. The horrors they had dealt out to others\r\nhad been so much a part of their settled lives that the thought of\r\nretribution had become a remote one, and so seemed the more startling\r\nnow that it came so closely upon them. They broke up early and left\r\ntheir leaders to their council.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, McMurdo!\u201d said McGinty when they were alone. The seven men sat\r\nfrozen in their seats.\r\n\r\n\u201cI said just now that I knew Birdy Edwards,\u201d McMurdo explained. \u201cI need\r\nnot tell you that he is not here under that name. He\u2019s a brave man, but\r\nnot a crazy one. He passes under the name of Steve Wilson, and he is\r\nlodging at Hobson\u2019s Patch.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause I fell into talk with him. I thought little of it at the time,\r\nnor would have given it a second thought but for this letter; but now\r\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s the man. I met him on the cars when I went down the line\r\non Wednesday\u2014a hard case if ever there was one. He said he was a\r\nreporter. I believed it for the moment. Wanted to know all he could\r\nabout the Scowrers and what he called \u2018the outrages\u2019 for a New York\r\npaper. Asked me every kind of question so as to get something. You bet\r\nI was giving nothing away. \u2018I\u2019d pay for it and pay well,\u2019 said he, \u2018if\r\nI could get some stuff that would suit my editor.\u2019 I said what I\r\nthought would please him best, and he handed me a twenty-dollar bill\r\nfor my information. \u2018There\u2019s ten times that for you,\u2019 said he, \u2018if you\r\ncan find me all that I want.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you tell him, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAny stuff I could make up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know he wasn\u2019t a newspaper man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you. He got out at Hobson\u2019s Patch, and so did I. I chanced\r\ninto the telegraph bureau, and he was leaving it.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018See here,\u2019 said the operator after he\u2019d gone out, \u2018I guess we should\r\ncharge double rates for this.\u2019\u2014\u2018I guess you should,\u2019 said I. He had\r\nfilled the form with stuff that might have been Chinese, for all we\r\ncould make of it. \u2018He fires a sheet of this off every day,\u2019 said the\r\nclerk. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said I; \u2018it\u2019s special news for his paper, and he\u2019s scared\r\nthat the others should tap it.\u2019 That was what the operator thought and\r\nwhat I thought at the time; but I think differently now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy Gar! I believe you are right,\u201d said McGinty. \u201cBut what do you allow\r\nthat we should do about it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not go right down now and fix him?\u201d someone suggested.\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, the sooner the better.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d start this next minute if I knew where we could find him,\u201d said\r\nMcMurdo. \u201cHe\u2019s in Hobson\u2019s Patch; but I don\u2019t know the house. I\u2019ve got\r\na plan, though, if you\u2019ll only take my advice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go to the Patch to-morrow morning. I\u2019ll find him through the\r\noperator. He can locate him, I guess. Well, then I\u2019ll tell him that I\u2019m\r\na Freeman myself. I\u2019ll offer him all the secrets of the lodge for a\r\nprice. You bet he\u2019ll tumble to it. I\u2019ll tell him the papers are at my\r\nhouse, and that it\u2019s as much as my life would be worth to let him come\r\nwhile folk were about. He\u2019ll see that that\u2019s horse sense. Let him come\r\nat ten o\u2019clock at night, and he shall see everything. That will fetch\r\nhim sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can plan the rest for yourselves. Widow MacNamara\u2019s is a lonely\r\nhouse. She\u2019s as true as steel and as deaf as a post. There\u2019s only\r\nScanlan and me in the house. If I get his promise\u2014and I\u2019ll let you know\r\nif I do\u2014I\u2019d have the whole seven of you come to me by nine o\u2019clock.\r\nWe\u2019ll get him in. If ever he gets out alive\u2014well, he can talk of Birdy\r\nEdwards\u2019s luck for the rest of his days!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a vacancy at Pinkerton\u2019s or I\u2019m mistaken. Leave it\r\nat that, McMurdo. At nine to-morrow we\u2019ll be with you. You once get the\r\ndoor shut behind him, and you can leave the rest with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\nThe Trapping of Birdy Edwards\r\n\r\n\r\nAs McMurdo had said, the house in which he lived was a lonely one and\r\nvery well suited for such a crime as they had planned. It was on the\r\nextreme fringe of the town and stood well back from the road. In any\r\nother case the conspirators would have simply called out their man, as\r\nthey had many a time before, and emptied their pistols into his body;\r\nbut in this instance it was very necessary to find out how much he\r\nknew, how he knew it, and what had been passed on to his employers.\r\n\r\nIt was possible that they were already too late and that the work had\r\nbeen done. If that was indeed so, they could at least have their\r\nrevenge upon the man who had done it. But they were hopeful that\r\nnothing of great importance had yet come to the detective\u2019s knowledge,\r\nas otherwise, they argued, he would not have troubled to write down and\r\nforward such trivial information as McMurdo claimed to have given him.\r\nHowever, all this they would learn from his own lips. Once in their\r\npower, they would find a way to make him speak. It was not the first\r\ntime that they had handled an unwilling witness.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo went to Hobson\u2019s Patch as agreed. The police seemed to take\r\nparticular interest in him that morning, and Captain Marvin\u2014he who had\r\nclaimed the old acquaintance with him at Chicago\u2014actually addressed him\r\nas he waited at the station. McMurdo turned away and refused to speak\r\nwith him. He was back from his mission in the afternoon, and saw\r\nMcGinty at the Union House.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is coming,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d said McGinty. The giant was in his shirt sleeves, with chains\r\nand seals gleaming athwart his ample waistcoat and a diamond twinkling\r\nthrough the fringe of his bristling beard. Drink and politics had made\r\nthe Boss a very rich as well as powerful man. The more terrible,\r\ntherefore, seemed that glimpse of the prison or the gallows which had\r\nrisen before him the night before.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you reckon he knows much?\u201d he asked anxiously.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo shook his head gloomily. \u201cHe\u2019s been here some time\u2014six weeks at\r\nthe least. I guess he didn\u2019t come into these parts to look at the\r\nprospect. If he has been working among us all that time with the\r\nrailroad money at his back, I should expect that he has got results,\r\nand that he has passed them on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a weak man in the lodge,\u201d cried McGinty. \u201cTrue as steel,\r\nevery man of them. And yet, by the Lord! there is that skunk Morris.\r\nWhat about him? If any man gives us away, it would be he. I\u2019ve a mind\r\nto send a couple of the boys round before evening to give him a beating\r\nup and see what they can get from him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there would be no harm in that,\u201d McMurdo answered. \u201cI won\u2019t deny\r\nthat I have a liking for Morris and would be sorry to see him come to\r\nharm. He has spoken to me once or twice over lodge matters, and though\r\nhe may not see them the same as you or I, he never seemed the sort that\r\nsqueals. But still it is not for me to stand between him and you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll fix the old devil!\u201d said McGinty with an oath. \u201cI\u2019ve had my eye\r\non him this year past.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you know best about that,\u201d McMurdo answered. \u201cBut whatever you\r\ndo must be to-morrow; for we must lie low until the Pinkerton affair is\r\nsettled up. We can\u2019t afford to set the police buzzing, to-day of all\r\ndays.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue for you,\u201d said McGinty. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll learn from Birdy Edwards\r\nhimself where he got his news if we have to cut his heart out first.\r\nDid he seem to scent a trap?\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo laughed. \u201cI guess I took him on his weak point,\u201d he said. \u201cIf\r\nhe could get on a good trail of the Scowrers, he\u2019s ready to follow it\r\ninto hell. I took his money,\u201d McMurdo grinned as he produced a wad of\r\ndollar notes, \u201cand as much more when he has seen all my papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat papers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there are no papers. But I filled him up about constitutions and\r\nbooks of rules and forms of membership. He expects to get right down to\r\nthe end of everything before he leaves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFaith, he\u2019s right there,\u201d said McGinty grimly. \u201cDidn\u2019t he ask you why\r\nyou didn\u2019t bring him the papers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs if I would carry such things, and me a suspected man, and Captain\r\nMarvin after speaking to me this very day at the depot!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, I heard of that,\u201d said McGinty. \u201cI guess the heavy end of this\r\nbusiness is coming on to you. We could put him down an old shaft when\r\nwe\u2019ve done with him; but however we work it we can\u2019t get past the man\r\nliving at Hobson\u2019s Patch and you being there to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo shrugged his shoulders. \u201cIf we handle it right, they can never\r\nprove the killing,\u201d said he. \u201cNo one can see him come to the house\r\nafter dark, and I\u2019ll lay to it that no one will see him go. Now see\r\nhere, Councillor, I\u2019ll show you my plan and I\u2019ll ask you to fit the\r\nothers into it. You will all come in good time. Very well. He comes at\r\nten. He is to tap three times, and me to open the door for him. Then\r\nI\u2019ll get behind him and shut it. He\u2019s our man then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all easy and plain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; but the next step wants considering. He\u2019s a hard proposition.\r\nHe\u2019s heavily armed. I\u2019ve fooled him proper, and yet he is likely to be\r\non his guard. Suppose I show him right into a room with seven men in it\r\nwhere he expected to find me alone. There is going to be shooting, and\r\nsomebody is going to be hurt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the noise is going to bring every damned copper in the township on\r\ntop of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess you are right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is how I should work it. You will all be in the big room\u2014same as\r\nyou saw when you had a chat with me. I\u2019ll open the door for him, show\r\nhim into the parlour beside the door, and leave him there while I get\r\nthe papers. That will give me the chance of telling you how things are\r\nshaping. Then I will go back to him with some faked papers. As he is\r\nreading them I will jump for him and get my grip on his pistol arm.\r\nYou\u2019ll hear me call and in you will rush. The quicker the better; for\r\nhe is as strong a man as I, and I may have more than I can manage. But\r\nI allow that I can hold him till you come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good plan,\u201d said McGinty. \u201cThe lodge will owe you a debt for\r\nthis. I guess when I move out of the chair I can put a name to the man\r\nthat\u2019s coming after me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, Councillor, I am little more than a recruit,\u201d said McMurdo; but\r\nhis face showed what he thought of the great man\u2019s compliment.\r\n\r\nWhen he had returned home he made his own preparations for the grim\r\nevening in front of him. First he cleaned, oiled, and loaded his Smith\r\n& Wesson revolver. Then he surveyed the room in which the detective was\r\nto be trapped. It was a large apartment, with a long deal table in the\r\ncentre, and the big stove at one side. At each of the other sides were\r\nwindows. There were no shutters on these: only light curtains which\r\ndrew across. McMurdo examined these attentively. No doubt it must have\r\nstruck him that the apartment was very exposed for so secret a meeting.\r\nYet its distance from the road made it of less consequence. Finally he\r\ndiscussed the matter with his fellow lodger. Scanlan, though a Scowrer,\r\nwas an inoffensive little man who was too weak to stand against the\r\nopinion of his comrades, but was secretly horrified by the deeds of\r\nblood at which he had sometimes been forced to assist. McMurdo told him\r\nshortly what was intended.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd if I were you, Mike Scanlan, I would take a night off and keep\r\nclear of it. There will be bloody work here before morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, indeed then, Mac,\u201d Scanlan answered. \u201cIt\u2019s not the will but the\r\nnerve that is wanting in me. When I saw Manager Dunn go down at the\r\ncolliery yonder it was just more than I could stand. I\u2019m not made for\r\nit, same as you or McGinty. If the lodge will think none the worse of\r\nme, I\u2019ll just do as you advise and leave you to yourselves for the\r\nevening.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe men came in good time as arranged. They were outwardly respectable\r\ncitizens, well clad and cleanly; but a judge of faces would have read\r\nlittle hope for Birdy Edwards in those hard mouths and remorseless\r\neyes. There was not a man in the room whose hands had not been reddened\r\na dozen times before. They were as hardened to human murder as a\r\nbutcher to sheep.\r\n\r\nForemost, of course, both in appearance and in guilt, was the\r\nformidable Boss. Harraway, the secretary, was a lean, bitter man with a\r\nlong, scraggy neck and nervous, jerky limbs, a man of incorruptible\r\nfidelity where the finances of the order were concerned, and with no\r\nnotion of justice or honesty to anyone beyond. The treasurer, Carter,\r\nwas a middle-aged man, with an impassive, rather sulky expression, and\r\na yellow parchment skin. He was a capable organizer, and the actual\r\ndetails of nearly every outrage had sprung from his plotting brain. The\r\ntwo Willabys were men of action, tall, lithe young fellows with\r\ndetermined faces, while their companion, Tiger Cormac, a heavy, dark\r\nyouth, was feared even by his own comrades for the ferocity of his\r\ndisposition. These were the men who assembled that night under the roof\r\nof McMurdo for the killing of the Pinkerton detective.\r\n\r\nTheir host had placed whisky upon the table, and they had hastened to\r\nprime themselves for the work before them. Baldwin and Cormac were\r\nalready half-drunk, and the liquor had brought out all their ferocity.\r\nCormac placed his hands on the stove for an instant\u2014it had been\r\nlighted, for the nights were still cold.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d said he, with an oath.\r\n\r\n\u201cAy,\u201d said Baldwin, catching his meaning. \u201cIf he is strapped to that,\r\nwe will have the truth out of him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have the truth out of him, never fear,\u201d said McMurdo. He had\r\nnerves of steel, this man; for though the whole weight of the affair\r\nwas on him his manner was as cool and unconcerned as ever. The others\r\nmarked it and applauded.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are the one to handle him,\u201d said the Boss approvingly. \u201cNot a\r\nwarning will he get till your hand is on his throat. It\u2019s a pity there\r\nare no shutters to your windows.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcMurdo went from one to the other and drew the curtains tighter. \u201cSure\r\nno one can spy upon us now. It\u2019s close upon the hour.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe he won\u2019t come. Maybe he\u2019ll get a sniff of danger,\u201d said the\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll come, never fear,\u201d McMurdo answered. \u201cHe is as eager to come as\r\nyou can be to see him. Hark to that!\u201d\r\n\r\nThey all sat like wax figures, some with their glasses arrested halfway\r\nto their lips. Three loud knocks had sounded at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d McMurdo raised his hand in caution. An exulting glance went\r\nround the circle, and hands were laid upon their weapons.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a sound, for your lives!\u201d McMurdo whispered, as he went from the\r\nroom, closing the door carefully behind him.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \u201cNot a sound, for your lives!\u201d McMurdo whispered.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith strained ears the murderers waited. They counted the steps of\r\ntheir comrade down the passage. Then they heard him open the outer\r\ndoor. There were a few words as of greeting. Then they were aware of a\r\nstrange step inside and of an unfamiliar voice. An instant later came\r\nthe slam of the door and the turning of the key in the lock. Their prey\r\nwas safe within the trap. Tiger Cormac laughed horribly, and Boss\r\nMcGinty clapped his great hand across his mouth.\r\n\r\n\u201cBe quiet, you fool!\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ll be the undoing of us yet!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a mutter of conversation from the next room. It seemed\r\ninterminable. Then the door opened, and McMurdo appeared, his finger\r\nupon his lip.\r\n\r\nHe came to the end of the table and looked round at them. A subtle\r\nchange had come over him. His manner was as of one who has great work\r\nto do. His face had set into granite firmness. His eyes shone with a\r\nfierce excitement behind his spectacles. He had become a visible leader\r\nof men. They stared at him with eager interest; but he said nothing.\r\nStill with the same singular gaze he looked from man to man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d cried Boss McGinty at last. \u201cIs he here? Is Birdy Edwards\r\nhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d McMurdo answered slowly. \u201cBirdy Edwards is here. I am Birdy\r\nEdwards!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere were ten seconds after that brief speech during which the room\r\nmight have been empty, so profound was the silence. The hissing of a\r\nkettle upon the stove rose sharp and strident to the ear. Seven white\r\nfaces, all turned upward to this man who dominated them, were set\r\nmotionless with utter terror. Then, with a sudden shivering of glass, a\r\nbristle of glistening rifle barrels broke through each window, while\r\nthe curtains were torn from their hangings.\r\n\r\nAt the sight Boss McGinty gave the roar of a wounded bear and plunged\r\nfor the half-opened door. A levelled revolver met him there with the\r\nstern blue eyes of Captain Marvin of the Mine Police gleaming behind\r\nthe sights. The Boss recoiled and fell back into his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re safer there, Councillor,\u201d said the man whom they had known as\r\nMcMurdo. \u201cAnd you, Baldwin, if you don\u2019t take your hand off your\r\npistol, you\u2019ll cheat the hangman yet. Pull it out, or by the Lord that\r\nmade me\u2014There, that will do. There are forty armed men round this\r\nhouse, and you can figure it out for yourself what chance you have.\r\nTake their pistols, Marvin!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no possible resistance under the menace of those rifles. The\r\nmen were disarmed. Sulky, sheepish, and amazed, they still sat round\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to say a word to you before we separate,\u201d said the man who\r\nhad trapped them. \u201cI guess we may not meet again until you see me on\r\nthe stand in the courthouse. I\u2019ll give you something to think over\r\nbetween now and then. You know me now for what I am. At last I can put\r\nmy cards on the table. I am Birdy Edwards of Pinkerton\u2019s. I was chosen\r\nto break up your gang. I had a hard and dangerous game to play. Not a\r\nsoul, not one soul, not my nearest and dearest, knew that I was playing\r\nit. Only Captain Marvin here and my employers knew that. But it\u2019s over\r\nto-night, thank God, and I am the winner!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe seven pale, rigid faces looked up at him. There was unappeasable\r\nhatred in their eyes. He read the relentless threat.\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe you think that the game is not over yet. Well, I take my chance\r\nof that. Anyhow, some of you will take no further hand, and there are\r\nsixty more besides yourselves that will see a jail this night. I\u2019ll\r\ntell you this, that when I was put upon this job I never believed there\r\nwas such a society as yours. I thought it was paper talk, and that I\r\nwould prove it so. They told me it was to do with the Freemen; so I\r\nwent to Chicago and was made one. Then I was surer than ever that it\r\nwas just paper talk; for I found no harm in the society, but a deal of\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, I had to carry out my job, and I came to the coal valleys. When\r\nI reached this place I learned that I was wrong and that it wasn\u2019t a\r\ndime novel after all. So I stayed to look after it. I never killed a\r\nman in Chicago. I never minted a dollar in my life. Those I gave you\r\nwere as good as any others; but I never spent money better. But I knew\r\nthe way into your good wishes and so I pretended to you that the law\r\nwas after me. It all worked just as I thought.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I joined your infernal lodge, and I took my share in your councils.\r\nMaybe they will say that I was as bad as you. They can say what they\r\nlike, so long as I get you. But what is the truth? The night I joined\r\nyou beat up old man Stanger. I could not warn him, for there was no\r\ntime; but I held your hand, Baldwin, when you would have killed him. If\r\never I have suggested things, so as to keep my place among you, they\r\nwere things which I knew I could prevent. I could not save Dunn and\r\nMenzies, for I did not know enough; but I will see that their murderers\r\nare hanged. I gave Chester Wilcox warning, so that when I blew his\r\nhouse in he and his folk were in hiding. There was many a crime that I\r\ncould not stop; but if you look back and think how often your man came\r\nhome the other road, or was down in town when you went for him, or\r\nstayed indoors when you thought he would come out, you\u2019ll see my work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou blasted traitor!\u201d hissed McGinty through his closed teeth.\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, John McGinty, you may call me that if it eases your smart. You and\r\nyour like have been the enemy of God and man in these parts. It took a\r\nman to get between you and the poor devils of men and women that you\r\nheld under your grip. There was just one way of doing it, and I did it.\r\nYou call me a traitor; but I guess there\u2019s many a thousand will call me\r\na deliverer that went down into hell to save them. I\u2019ve had three\r\nmonths of it. I wouldn\u2019t have three such months again if they let me\r\nloose in the treasury at Washington for it. I had to stay till I had it\r\nall, every man and every secret right here in this hand. I\u2019d have\r\nwaited a little longer if it hadn\u2019t come to my knowledge that my secret\r\nwas coming out. A letter had come into the town that would have set you\r\nwise to it all. Then I had to act and act quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve nothing more to say to you, except that when my time comes I\u2019ll\r\ndie the easier when I think of the work I have done in this valley.\r\nNow, Marvin, I\u2019ll keep you no more. Take them in and get it over.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere is little more to tell. Scanlan had been given a sealed note to\r\nbe left at the address of Miss Ettie Shafter, a mission which he had\r\naccepted with a wink and a knowing smile. In the early hours of the\r\nmorning a beautiful woman and a much muffled man boarded a special\r\ntrain which had been sent by the railroad company, and made a swift,\r\nunbroken journey out of the land of danger. It was the last time that\r\never either Ettie or her lover set foot in the Valley of Fear. Ten days\r\nlater they were married in Chicago, with old Jacob Shafter as witness\r\nof the wedding.\r\n\r\nThe trial of the Scowrers was held far from the place where their\r\nadherents might have terrified the guardians of the law. In vain they\r\nstruggled. In vain the money of the lodge\u2014money squeezed by blackmail\r\nout of the whole countryside\u2014was spent like water in the attempt to\r\nsave them. That cold, clear, unimpassioned statement from one who knew\r\nevery detail of their lives, their organization, and their crimes was\r\nunshaken by all the wiles of their defenders. At last after so many\r\nyears they were broken and scattered. The cloud was lifted forever from\r\nthe valley.\r\n\r\nMcGinty met his fate upon the scaffold, cringing and whining when the\r\nlast hour came. Eight of his chief followers shared his fate. Fifty-odd\r\nhad various degrees of imprisonment. The work of Birdy Edwards was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as he had guessed, the game was not over yet. There was\r\nanother hand to be played, and yet another and another. Ted Baldwin,\r\nfor one, had escaped the scaffold; so had the Willabys; so had several\r\nothers of the fiercest spirits of the gang. For ten years they were out\r\nof the world, and then came a day when they were free once more\u2014a day\r\nwhich Edwards, who knew his men, was very sure would be an end of his\r\nlife of peace. They had sworn an oath on all that they thought holy to\r\nhave his blood as a vengeance for their comrades. And well they strove\r\nto keep their vow!\r\n\r\nFrom Chicago he was chased, after two attempts so near success that it\r\nwas sure that the third would get him. From Chicago he went under a\r\nchanged name to California, and it was there that the light went for a\r\ntime out of his life when Ettie Edwards died. Once again he was nearly\r\nkilled, and once again under the name of Douglas he worked in a lonely\r\ncanyon, where with an English partner named Barker he amassed a\r\nfortune. At last there came a warning to him that the bloodhounds were\r\non his track once more, and he cleared\u2014only just in time\u2014for England.\r\nAnd thence came the John Douglas who for a second time married a worthy\r\nmate, and lived for five years as a Sussex county gentleman, a life\r\nwhich ended with the strange happenings of which we have heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEpilogue\r\n\r\n\r\nThe police trial had passed, in which the case of John Douglas was\r\nreferred to a higher court. So had the Quarter Sessions, at which he\r\nwas acquitted as having acted in self-defense.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet him out of England at any cost,\u201d wrote Holmes to the wife. \u201cThere\r\nare forces here which may be more dangerous than those he has escaped.\r\nThere is no safety for your husband in England.\u201d\r\n\r\nTwo months had gone by, and the case had to some extent passed from our\r\nminds. Then one morning there came an enigmatic note slipped into our\r\nletter box. \u201cDear me, Mr. Holmes. Dear me!\u201d said this singular epistle.\r\nThere was neither superscription nor signature. I laughed at the quaint\r\nmessage; but Holmes showed unwonted seriousness.\r\n\r\n\u201cDeviltry, Watson!\u201d he remarked, and sat long with a clouded brow.\r\n\r\nLate last night Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, brought up a message that a\r\ngentleman wished to see Mr. Holmes, and that the matter was of the\r\nutmost importance. Close at the heels of his messenger came Cecil\r\nBarker, our friend of the moated Manor House. His face was drawn and\r\nhaggard.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had bad news\u2014terrible news, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cI feared as much,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have not had a cable, have you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have had a note from someone who has.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s poor Douglas. They tell me his name is Edwards; but he will\r\nalways be Jack Douglas of Benito Canyon to me. I told you that they\r\nstarted together for South Africa in the Palmyra three weeks ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe ship reached Cape Town last night. I received this cable from Mrs.\r\nDouglas this morning:\r\n\r\n\u201cJack has been lost overboard in gale off St. Helena. No one knows how\r\naccident occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cIVY DOUGLAS.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! It came like that, did it?\u201d said Holmes thoughtfully. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve\r\nno doubt it was well stage-managed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean that you think there was no accident?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was murdered?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I think also. These infernal Scowrers, this cursed vindictive nest\r\nof criminals\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, my good sir,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThere is a master hand here. It is\r\nno case of sawed-off shotguns and clumsy six-shooters. You can tell an\r\nold master by the sweep of his brush. I can tell a Moriarty when I see\r\none. This crime is from London, not from America.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut for what motive?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause it is done by a man who cannot afford to fail, one whose whole\r\nunique position depends upon the fact that all he does must succeed. A\r\ngreat brain and a huge organization have been turned to the extinction\r\nof one man. It is crushing the nut with the triphammer\u2014an absurd\r\nextravagance of energy\u2014but the nut is very effectually crushed all the\r\nsame.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow came this man to have anything to do with it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can only say that the first word that ever came to us of the\r\nbusiness was from one of his lieutenants. These Americans were well\r\nadvised. Having an English job to do, they took into partnership, as\r\nany foreign criminal could do, this great consultant in crime. From\r\nthat moment their man was doomed. At first he would content himself by\r\nusing his machinery in order to find their victim. Then he would\r\nindicate how the matter might be treated. Finally, when he read in the\r\nreports of the failure of this agent, he would step in himself with a\r\nmaster touch. You heard me warn this man at Birlstone Manor House that\r\nthe coming danger was greater than the past. Was I right?\u201d\r\n\r\nBarker beat his head with his clenched fist in his impotent anger. \u201cDo\r\nnot tell me that we have to sit down under this? Do you say that no one\r\ncan ever get level with this king devil?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t say that,\u201d said Holmes, and his eyes seemed to be looking\r\nfar into the future. \u201cI don\u2019t say that he can\u2019t be beat. But you must\r\ngive me time\u2014you must give me time!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe all sat in silence for some minutes while those fateful eyes still\r\nstrained to pierce the veil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE VALLEY OF FEAR ***\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.

The Strange Story of Jonathan Small\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I\r\nThe Science of Deduction\r\n\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantel-piece and\r\nhis hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long,\r\nwhite, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled back\r\nhis left shirt-cuff. For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully\r\nupon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with\r\ninnumerable puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp point home,\r\npressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined\r\narm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThree times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, but\r\ncustom had not reconciled my mind to it. On the contrary, from day to\r\nday I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled\r\nnightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to\r\nprotest. Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver\r\nmy soul upon the subject, but there was that in the cool, nonchalant\r\nair of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would\r\ncare to take anything approaching to a liberty. His great powers, his\r\nmasterly manner, and the experience which I had had of his many\r\nextraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nYet upon that afternoon, whether it was the Beaune which I had taken\r\nwith my lunch, or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme\r\ndeliberation of his manner, I suddenly felt that I could hold out no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich is it to-day?\u201d I asked,\u2014\u201cmorphine or cocaine?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume which he\r\nhad opened. \u201cIt is cocaine,\u201d he said,\u2014\u201ca seven-per-cent. solution.\r\nWould you care to try it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed,\u201d I answered, brusquely. \u201cMy constitution has not got over\r\nthe Afghan campaign yet. I cannot afford to throw any extra strain upon\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe smiled at my vehemence. \u201cPerhaps you are right, Watson,\u201d he said. \u201cI\r\nsuppose that its influence is physically a bad one. I find it, however,\r\nso transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that its\r\nsecondary action is a matter of small moment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut consider!\u201d I said, earnestly. \u201cCount the cost! Your brain may, as\r\nyou say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological and morbid\r\nprocess, which involves increased tissue-change and may at last leave a\r\npermanent weakness. You know, too, what a black reaction comes upon\r\nyou. Surely the game is hardly worth the candle. Why should you, for a\r\nmere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great powers with which\r\nyou have been endowed? Remember that I speak not only as one comrade to\r\nanother, but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to\r\nsome extent answerable.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe did not seem offended. On the contrary, he put his finger-tips\r\ntogether and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair, like one who\r\nhas a relish for conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy mind,\u201d he said, \u201crebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me\r\nwork, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate\r\nanalysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then\r\nwith artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence.\r\nI crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own\r\nparticular profession,\u2014or rather created it, for I am the only one in\r\nthe world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe only unofficial detective?\u201d I said, raising my eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe only unofficial consulting detective,\u201d he answered. \u201cI am the last\r\nand highest court of appeal in detection. When Gregson or Lestrade or\r\nAthelney Jones are out of their depths\u2014which, by the way, is their\r\nnormal state\u2014the matter is laid before me. I examine the data, as an\r\nexpert, and pronounce a specialist\u2019s opinion. I claim no credit in such\r\ncases. My name figures in no newspaper. The work itself, the pleasure\r\nof finding a field for my peculiar powers, is my highest reward. But\r\nyou have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the\r\nJefferson Hope case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d said I, cordially. \u201cI was never so struck by anything in\r\nmy life. I even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhat\r\nfantastic title of \u2018A Study in Scarlet.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head sadly. \u201cI glanced over it,\u201d said he. \u201cHonestly, I\r\ncannot congratulate you upon it. Detection is, or ought to be, an exact\r\nscience, and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner.\r\nYou have attempted to tinge it with romanticism, which produces much\r\nthe same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the\r\nfifth proposition of Euclid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the romance was there,\u201d I remonstrated. \u201cI could not tamper with\r\nthe facts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome facts should be suppressed, or at least a just sense of\r\nproportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in the\r\ncase which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from\r\neffects to causes by which I succeeded in unraveling it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially\r\ndesigned to please him. I confess, too, that I was irritated by the\r\negotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be\r\ndevoted to his own special doings. More than once during the years that\r\nI had lived with him in Baker Street I had observed that a small vanity\r\nunderlay my companion\u2019s quiet and didactic manner. I made no remark,\r\nhowever, but sat nursing my wounded leg. I had a Jezail bullet through\r\nit some time before, and, though it did not prevent me from walking, it\r\nached wearily at every change of the weather.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy practice has extended recently to the Continent,\u201d said Holmes,\r\nafter a while, filling up his old brier-root pipe. \u201cI was consulted\r\nlast week by Fran\u00e7ois Le Villard, who, as you probably know, has come\r\nrather to the front lately in the French detective service. He has all\r\nthe Celtic power of quick intuition, but he is deficient in the wide\r\nrange of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments\r\nof his art. The case was concerned with a will, and possessed some\r\nfeatures of interest. I was able to refer him to two parallel cases,\r\nthe one at Riga in 1857, and the other at St. Louis in 1871, which have\r\nsuggested to him the true solution. Here is the letter which I had this\r\nmorning acknowledging my assistance.\u201d He tossed over, as he spoke, a\r\ncrumpled sheet of foreign notepaper. I glanced my eyes down it,\r\ncatching a profusion of notes of admiration, with stray \u201cmagnifiques,\u201d\r\n\u201ccoup-de-ma\u00eetres,\u201d and \u201ctours-de-force,\u201d all testifying to the ardent\r\nadmiration of the Frenchman.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe speaks as a pupil to his master,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he rates my assistance too highly,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, lightly.\r\n\u201cHe has considerable gifts himself. He possesses two out of the three\r\nqualities necessary for the ideal detective. He has the power of\r\nobservation and that of deduction. He is only wanting in knowledge; and\r\nthat may come in time. He is now translating my small works into\r\nFrench.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour works?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, didn\u2019t you know?\u201d he cried, laughing. \u201cYes, I have been guilty of\r\nseveral monographs. They are all upon technical subjects. Here, for\r\nexample, is one \u2018Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of the Various\r\nTobaccoes.\u2019 In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar-,\r\ncigarette-, and pipe-tobacco, with coloured plates illustrating the\r\ndifference in the ash. It is a point which is continually turning up in\r\ncriminal trials, and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a\r\nclue. If you can say definitely, for example, that some murder has been\r\ndone by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah, it obviously narrows\r\nyour field of search. To the trained eye there is as much difference\r\nbetween the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff of\r\nbird\u2019s-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have an extraordinary genius for minuti\u00e6,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI appreciate their importance. Here is my monograph upon the tracing\r\nof footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as a\r\npreserver of impresses. Here, too, is a curious little work upon the\r\ninfluence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with lithotypes of the\r\nhands of slaters, sailors, corkcutters, compositors, weavers, and\r\ndiamond-polishers. That is a matter of great practical interest to the\r\nscientific detective,\u2014especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or in\r\ndiscovering the antecedents of criminals. But I weary you with my\r\nhobby.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d I answered, earnestly. \u201cIt is of the greatest interest to\r\nme, especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your\r\npractical application of it. But you spoke just now of observation and\r\ndeduction. Surely the one to some extent implies the other.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, hardly,\u201d he answered, leaning back luxuriously in his arm-chair,\r\nand sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe. \u201cFor example,\r\nobservation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street\r\nPost-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there\r\nyou dispatched a telegram.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRight!\u201d said I. \u201cRight on both points! But I confess that I don\u2019t see\r\nhow you arrived at it. It was a sudden impulse upon my part, and I have\r\nmentioned it to no one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is simplicity itself,\u201d he remarked, chuckling at my surprise,\u2014\u201cso\r\nabsurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous; and yet it may\r\nserve to define the limits of observation and of deduction. Observation\r\ntells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep.\r\nJust opposite the Wigmore Street Office they have taken up the pavement\r\nand thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that it is difficult\r\nto avoid treading in it in entering. The earth is of this peculiar\r\nreddish tint which is found, as far as I know, nowhere else in the\r\nneighbourhood. So much is observation. The rest is deduction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow, then, did you deduce the telegram?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, of course I knew that you had not written a letter, since I sat\r\nopposite to you all morning. I see also in your open desk there that\r\nyou have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post-cards. What could\r\nyou go into the post-office for, then, but to send a wire? Eliminate\r\nall other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn this case it certainly is so,\u201d I replied, after a little thought.\r\n\u201cThe thing, however, is, as you say, of the simplest. Would you think\r\nme impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d he answered, \u201cit would prevent me from taking a\r\nsecond dose of cocaine. I should be delighted to look into any problem\r\nwhich you might submit to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object\r\nin daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it\r\nin such a way that a trained observer might read it. Now, I have here a\r\nwatch which has recently come into my possession. Would you have the\r\nkindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the\r\nlate owner?\u201d\r\n\r\nI handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my\r\nheart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I\r\nintended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he\r\noccasionally assumed. He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at\r\nthe dial, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his naked\r\neyes and then with a powerful convex lens. I could hardly keep from\r\nsmiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to and\r\nhanded it back.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are hardly any data,\u201d he remarked. \u201cThe watch has been recently\r\ncleaned, which robs me of my most suggestive facts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt was cleaned before being sent to me.\u201d\r\nIn my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and\r\nimpotent excuse to cover his failure. What data could he expect from an\r\nuncleaned watch?\r\n\r\n\u201cThough unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren,\u201d he\r\nobserved, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes.\r\n\u201cSubject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to\r\nyour elder brother, who inherited it from your father.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat you gather, no doubt, from the H. W. upon the back?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. The W. suggests your own name. The date of the watch is\r\nnearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch: so\r\nit was made for the last generation. Jewelry usually descends to the\r\neldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as the father.\r\nYour father has, if I remember right, been dead many years. It has,\r\ntherefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRight, so far,\u201d said I. \u201cAnything else?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was a man of untidy habits,\u2014very untidy and careless. He was left\r\nwith good prospects, but he threw away his chances, lived for some time\r\nin poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity, and finally,\r\ntaking to drink, he died. That is all I can gather.\u201d\r\n\r\nI sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with\r\nconsiderable bitterness in my heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is unworthy of you, Holmes,\u201d I said. \u201cI could not have believed\r\nthat you would have descended to this. You have made inquires into the\r\nhistory of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this\r\nknowledge in some fanciful way. You cannot expect me to believe that\r\nyou have read all this from his old watch! It is unkind, and, to speak\r\nplainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear doctor,\u201d said he, kindly, \u201cpray accept my apologies. Viewing\r\nthe matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal and\r\npainful a thing it might be to you. I assure you, however, that I never\r\neven knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts?\r\nThey are absolutely correct in every particular.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that is good luck. I could only say what was the balance of\r\nprobability. I did not at all expect to be so accurate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it was not mere guess-work?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no: I never guess. It is a shocking habit,\u2014destructive to the\r\nlogical faculty. What seems strange to you is only so because you do\r\nnot follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which\r\nlarge inferences may depend. For example, I began by stating that your\r\nbrother was careless. When you observe the lower part of that\r\nwatch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places, but it\r\nis cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard\r\nobjects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket. Surely it is no\r\ngreat feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch so\r\ncavalierly must be a careless man. Neither is it a very far-fetched\r\ninference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty\r\nwell provided for in other respects.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded, to show that I followed his reasoning.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take a\r\nwatch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the\r\ninside of the case. It is more handy than a label, as there is no risk\r\nof the number being lost or transposed. There are no less than four\r\nsuch numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case.\r\nInference,\u2014that your brother was often at low water. Secondary\r\ninference,\u2014that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he could not\r\nhave redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the inner\r\nplate, which contains the key-hole. Look at the thousands of scratches\r\nall round the hole,\u2014marks where the key has slipped. What sober man\u2019s\r\nkey could have scored those grooves? But you will never see a\r\ndrunkard\u2019s watch without them. He winds it at night, and he leaves\r\nthese traces of his unsteady hand. Where is the mystery in all this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is as clear as daylight,\u201d I answered. \u201cI regret the injustice which\r\nI did you. I should have had more faith in your marvellous faculty. May\r\nI ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone. Hence the cocaine. I cannot live without brain-work. What else\r\nis there to live for? Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary,\r\ndismal, unprofitable world? See how the yellow fog swirls down the\r\nstreet and drifts across the dun-coloured houses. What could be more\r\nhopelessly prosaic and material? What is the use of having powers,\r\ndoctor, when one has no field upon which to exert them? Crime is\r\ncommonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save those\r\nwhich are commonplace have any function upon earth.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade, when with a crisp knock\r\nour landlady entered, bearing a card upon the brass salver.\r\n\r\n\u201cA young lady for you, sir,\u201d she said, addressing my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Mary Morstan,\u201d he read. \u201cHum! I have no recollection of the name.\r\nAsk the young lady to step up, Mrs. Hudson. Don\u2019t go, doctor. I should\r\nprefer that you remain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\nThe Statement of the Case\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure\r\nof manner. She was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well gloved, and\r\ndressed in the most perfect taste. There was, however, a plainness and\r\nsimplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of limited\r\nmeans. The dress was a sombre greyish beige, untrimmed and unbraided,\r\nand she wore a small turban of the same dull hue, relieved only by a\r\nsuspicion of white feather in the side. Her face had neither regularity\r\nof feature nor beauty of complexion, but her expression was sweet and\r\namiable, and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and\r\nsympathetic. In an experience of women which extends over many nations\r\nand three separate continents, I have never looked upon a face which\r\ngave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature. I could not\r\nbut observe that as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed for\r\nher, her lip trembled, her hand quivered, and she showed every sign of\r\nintense inward agitation.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have come to you, Mr. Holmes,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause you once enabled\r\nmy employer, Mrs. Cecil Forrester, to unravel a little domestic\r\ncomplication. She was much impressed by your kindness and skill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Cecil Forrester,\u201d he repeated thoughtfully. \u201cI believe that I was\r\nof some slight service to her. The case, however, as I remember it, was\r\na very simple one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe did not think so. But at least you cannot say the same of mine. I\r\ncan hardly imagine anything more strange, more utterly inexplicable,\r\nthan the situation in which I find myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes rubbed his hands, and his eyes glistened. He leaned forward in\r\nhis chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his\r\nclear-cut, hawklike features. \u201cState your case,\u201d said he, in brisk,\r\nbusiness tones.\r\n\r\nI felt that my position was an embarrassing one. \u201cYou will, I am sure,\r\nexcuse me,\u201d I said, rising from my chair.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me.\r\n\u201cIf your friend,\u201d she said, \u201cwould be good enough to stop, he might be\r\nof inestimable service to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nI relapsed into my chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cBriefly,\u201d she continued, \u201cthe facts are these. My father was an\r\nofficer in an Indian regiment who sent me home when I was quite a\r\nchild. My mother was dead, and I had no relative in England. I was\r\nplaced, however, in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh,\r\nand there I remained until I was seventeen years of age. In the year\r\n1878 my father, who was senior captain of his regiment, obtained twelve\r\nmonths\u2019 leave and came home. He telegraphed to me from London that he\r\nhad arrived all safe, and directed me to come down at once, giving the\r\nLangham Hotel as his address. His message, as I remember, was full of\r\nkindness and love. On reaching London I drove to the Langham, and was\r\ninformed that Captain Morstan was staying there, but that he had gone\r\nout the night before and had not yet returned. I waited all day without\r\nnews of him. That night, on the advice of the manager of the hotel, I\r\ncommunicated with the police, and next morning we advertised in all the\r\npapers. Our inquiries led to no result; and from that day to this no\r\nword has ever been heard of my unfortunate father. He came home with\r\nhis heart full of hope, to find some peace, some comfort, and instead\u2014\u201d\r\nShe put her hand to her throat, and a choking sob cut short the\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe date?\u201d asked Holmes, opening his note-book.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe disappeared upon the 3rd of December, 1878,\u2014nearly ten years ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis luggage?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRemained at the hotel. There was nothing in it to suggest a clue,\u2014some\r\nclothes, some books, and a considerable number of curiosities from the\r\nAndaman Islands. He had been one of the officers in charge of the\r\nconvict-guard there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad he any friends in town?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly one that we know of,\u2014Major Sholto, of his own regiment, the 34th\r\nBombay Infantry. The major had retired some little time before, and\r\nlived at Upper Norwood. We communicated with him, of course, but he did\r\nnot even know that his brother officer was in England.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA singular case,\u201d remarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have not yet described to you the most singular part. About six\r\nyears ago\u2014to be exact, upon the 4th of May, 1882\u2014an advertisement\r\nappeared in the _Times_ asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan and\r\nstating that it would be to her advantage to come forward. There was no\r\nname or address appended. I had at that time just entered the family of\r\nMrs. Cecil Forrester in the capacity of governess. By her advice I\r\npublished my address in the advertisement column. The same day there\r\narrived through the post a small card-board box addressed to me, which\r\nI found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl. No word of writing\r\nwas enclosed. Since then every year upon the same date there has always\r\nappeared a similar box, containing a similar pearl, without any clue as\r\nto the sender. They have been pronounced by an expert to be of a rare\r\nvariety and of considerable value. You can see for yourselves that they\r\nare very handsome.\u201d She opened a flat box as she spoke, and showed me\r\nsix of the finest pearls that I had ever seen.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour statement is most interesting,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cHas\r\nanything else occurred to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and no later than to-day. That is why I have come to you. This\r\nmorning I received this letter, which you will perhaps read for\r\nyourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThe envelope too, please. Postmark, London,\r\nS.W. Date, July 7. Hum! Man\u2019s thumb-mark on corner,\u2014probably postman.\r\nBest quality paper. Envelopes at sixpence a packet. Particular man in\r\nhis stationery. No address. \u2018Be at the third pillar from the left\r\noutside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven o\u2019clock. If you are\r\ndistrustful, bring two friends. You are a wronged woman, and shall have\r\njustice. Do not bring police. If you do, all will be in vain. Your\r\nunknown friend.\u2019 Well, really, this is a very pretty little mystery.\r\nWhat do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is exactly what I want to ask you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we shall most certainly go. You and I and\u2014yes, why, Dr. Watson is\r\nthe very man. Your correspondent says two friends. He and I have worked\r\ntogether before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut would he come?\u201d she asked, with something appealing in her voice\r\nand expression.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should be proud and happy,\u201d said I, fervently, \u201cif I can be of any\r\nservice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are both very kind,\u201d she answered. \u201cI have led a retired life, and\r\nhave no friends whom I could appeal to. If I am here at six it will do,\r\nI suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must not be later,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThere is one other point,\r\nhowever. Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-box\r\naddresses?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have them here,\u201d she answered, producing half a dozen pieces of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are certainly a model client. You have the correct intuition. Let\r\nus see, now.\u201d He spread out the papers upon the table, and gave little\r\ndarting glances from one to the other. \u201cThey are disguised hands,\r\nexcept the letter,\u201d he said, presently, \u201cbut there can be no question\r\nas to the authorship. See how the irrepressible Greek _e_ will break\r\nout, and see the twirl of the final _s_. They are undoubtedly by the\r\nsame person. I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss Morstan,\r\nbut is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your\r\nfather?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing could be more unlike.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI expected to hear you say so. We shall look out for you, then, at\r\nsix. Pray allow me to keep the papers. I may look into the matter\r\nbefore then. It is only half-past three. _Au revoir_, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Au revoir_,\u201d said our visitor, and, with a bright, kindly glance from\r\none to the other of us, she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and\r\nhurried away. Standing at the window, I watched her walking briskly\r\ndown the street, until the grey turban and white feather were but a\r\nspeck in the sombre crowd.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a very attractive woman!\u201d I exclaimed, turning to my companion.\r\n\r\nHe had lit his pipe again, and was leaning back with drooping eyelids.\r\n\u201cIs she?\u201d he said, languidly. \u201cI did not observe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou really are an automaton,\u2014a calculating-machine!\u201d I cried. \u201cThere\r\nis something positively inhuman in you at times.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe smiled gently. \u201cIt is of the first importance,\u201d he said, \u201cnot to\r\nallow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities. A client is to\r\nme a mere unit,\u2014a factor in a problem. The emotional qualities are\r\nantagonistic to clear reasoning. I assure you that the most winning\r\nwoman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for\r\ntheir insurance-money, and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is\r\na philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the\r\nLondon poor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn this case, however\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never make exceptions. An exception disproves the rule. Have you\r\never had occasion to study character in handwriting? What do you make\r\nof this fellow\u2019s scribble?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is legible and regular,\u201d I answered. \u201cA man of business habits and\r\nsome force of character.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head. \u201cLook at his long letters,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\r\nhardly rise above the common herd. That _d_ might be an _a_, and that\r\n_l_ an _e_. Men of character always differentiate their long letters,\r\nhowever illegibly they may write. There is vacillation in his _k_\u2019s and\r\nself-esteem in his capitals. I am going out now. I have some few\r\nreferences to make. Let me recommend this book,\u2014one of the most\r\nremarkable ever penned. It is Winwood Reade\u2019s \u2018Martyrdom of Man.\u2019 I\r\nshall be back in an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\nI sat in the window with the volume in my hand, but my thoughts were\r\nfar from the daring speculations of the writer. My mind ran upon our\r\nlate visitor,\u2014her smiles, the deep rich tones of her voice, the strange\r\nmystery which overhung her life. If she were seventeen at the time of\r\nher father\u2019s disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now,\u2014a sweet\r\nage, when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a little\r\nsobered by experience. So I sat and mused, until such dangerous\r\nthoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged\r\nfuriously into the latest treatise upon pathology. What was I, an army\r\nsurgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account, that I should\r\ndare to think of such things? She was a unit, a factor,\u2014nothing more.\r\nIf my future were black, it was better surely to face it like a man\r\nthan to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o\u2019-the-wisps of the\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\nIn Quest of a Solution\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was half-past five before Holmes returned. He was bright, eager, and\r\nin excellent spirits,\u2014a mood which in his case alternated with fits of\r\nthe blackest depression.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no great mystery in this matter,\u201d he said, taking the cup of\r\ntea which I had poured out for him. \u201cThe facts appear to admit of only\r\none explanation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! you have solved it already?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that would be too much to say. I have discovered a suggestive\r\nfact, that is all. It is, however, _very_ suggestive. The details are\r\nstill to be added. I have just found, on consulting the back files of\r\nthe _Times_, that Major Sholto, of Upper Norwood, late of the 34th\r\nBombay Infantry, died upon the 28th of April, 1882.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo? You surprise me. Look at it in this way, then. Captain Morstan\r\ndisappears. The only person in London whom he could have visited is\r\nMajor Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London.\r\nFour years later Sholto dies. _Within a week of his death_ Captain\r\nMorstan\u2019s daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeated from\r\nyear to year, and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a\r\nwronged woman. What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of\r\nher father? And why should the presents begin immediately after\r\nSholto\u2019s death, unless it is that Sholto\u2019s heir knows something of the\r\nmystery and desires to make compensation? Have you any alternative\r\ntheory which will meet the facts?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what a strange compensation! And how strangely made! Why, too,\r\nshould he write a letter now, rather than six years ago? Again, the\r\nletter speaks of giving her justice. What justice can she have? It is\r\ntoo much to suppose that her father is still alive. There is no other\r\ninjustice in her case that you know of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties,\u201d said\r\nSherlock Holmes, pensively. \u201cBut our expedition of to-night will solve\r\nthem all. Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is inside. Are\r\nyou all ready? Then we had better go down, for it is a little past the\r\nhour.\u201d\r\n\r\nI picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes\r\ntook his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket. It\r\nwas clear that he thought that our night\u2019s work might be a serious one.\r\n\r\nMiss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face was\r\ncomposed, but pale. She must have been more than woman if she did not\r\nfeel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were\r\nembarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answered\r\nthe few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her.\r\n\r\n\u201cMajor Sholto was a very particular friend of papa\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cHis\r\nletters were full of allusions to the major. He and papa were in\r\ncommand of the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were thrown a\r\ngreat deal together. By the way, a curious paper was found in papa\u2019s\r\ndesk which no one could understand. I don\u2019t suppose that it is of the\r\nslightest importance, but I thought you might care to see it, so I\r\nbrought it with me. It is here.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee.\r\nHe then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is paper of native Indian manufacture,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIt has at\r\nsome time been pinned to a board. The diagram upon it appears to be a\r\nplan of part of a large building with numerous halls, corridors, and\r\npassages. At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above it\r\nis \u20183.37 from left,\u2019 in faded pencil-writing. In the left-hand corner\r\nis a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms\r\ntouching. Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse characters,\r\n\u2018The sign of the four,\u2014Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan,\r\nDost Akbar.\u2019 No, I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the\r\nmatter. Yet it is evidently a document of importance. It has been kept\r\ncarefully in a pocket-book; for the one side is as clean as the other.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was in his pocket-book that we found it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPreserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be of\r\nuse to us. I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much\r\ndeeper and more subtle than I at first supposed. I must reconsider my\r\nideas.\u201d He leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his drawn brow\r\nand his vacant eye that he was thinking intently. Miss Morstan and I\r\nchatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible\r\noutcome, but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until\r\nthe end of our journey.\r\n\r\nIt was a September evening, and not yet seven o\u2019clock, but the day had\r\nbeen a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city.\r\nMud-coloured clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets. Down the\r\nStrand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw\r\na feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement. The yellow glare\r\nfrom the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporous air, and\r\nthrew a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare. There\r\nwas, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-like in the endless\r\nprocession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of\r\nlight,\u2014sad faces and glad, haggard and merry. Like all human kind, they\r\nflitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom once\r\nmore. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy evening,\r\nwith the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined to make\r\nme nervous and depressed. I could see from Miss Morstan\u2019s manner that\r\nshe was suffering from the same feeling. Holmes alone could rise\r\nsuperior to petty influences. He held his open note-book upon his knee,\r\nand from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light\r\nof his pocket-lantern.\r\n\r\nAt the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the\r\nside-entrances. In front a continuous stream of hansoms and\r\nfour-wheelers were rattling up, discharging their cargoes of\r\nshirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded women. We had hardly\r\nreached the third pillar, which was our rendezvous, before a small,\r\ndark, brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you the parties who come with Miss Morstan?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen are my friends,\u201d said she.\r\n\r\nHe bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us.\r\n\u201cYou will excuse me, miss,\u201d he said with a certain dogged manner, \u201cbut\r\nI was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions\r\nis a police-officer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI give you my word on that,\u201d she answered.\r\n\r\nHe gave a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab led across a\r\nfour-wheeler and opened the door. The man who had addressed us mounted\r\nto the box, while we took our places inside. We had hardly done so\r\nbefore the driver whipped up his horse, and we plunged away at a\r\nfurious pace through the foggy streets.\r\n\r\nThe situation was a curious one. We were driving to an unknown place,\r\non an unknown errand. Yet our invitation was either a complete\r\nhoax,\u2014which was an inconceivable hypothesis,\u2014or else we had good reason\r\nto think that important issues might hang upon our journey. Miss\r\nMorstan\u2019s demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever. I endeavored\r\nto cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in\r\nAfghanistan; but, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at our\r\nsituation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were\r\nslightly involved. To this day she declares that I told her one moving\r\nanecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night,\r\nand how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it. At first I had some\r\nidea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon, what with\r\nour pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London, I lost my\r\nbearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed to be going a very long\r\nway. Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and he muttered the\r\nnames as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous\r\nby-streets.\r\n\r\n\u201cRochester Row,\u201d said he. \u201cNow Vincent Square. Now we come out on the\r\nVauxhall Bridge Road. We are making for the Surrey side, apparently.\r\nYes, I thought so. Now we are on the bridge. You can catch glimpses of\r\nthe river.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe did indeed get a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames with the\r\nlamps shining upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dashed on, and\r\nwas soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side.\r\n\r\n\u201cWordsworth Road,\u201d said my companion. \u201cPriory Road. Lark Hall Lane.\r\nStockwell Place. Robert Street. Cold Harbor Lane. Our quest does not\r\nappear to take us to very fashionable regions.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had, indeed, reached a questionable and forbidding neighbourhood.\r\nLong lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare\r\nand tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner. Then came rows of\r\ntwo-storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden, and then\r\nagain interminable lines of new staring brick buildings,\u2014the monster\r\ntentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country. At\r\nlast the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace. None of the\r\nother houses were inhabited, and that at which we stopped was as dark\r\nas its neighbours, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window. On\r\nour knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindoo\r\nservant clad in a yellow turban, white loose-fitting clothes, and a\r\nyellow sash. There was something strangely incongruous in this Oriental\r\nfigure framed in the commonplace doorway of a third-rate suburban\r\ndwelling-house.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Sahib awaits you,\u201d said he, and even as he spoke there came a high\r\npiping voice from some inner room. \u201cShow them in to me, khitmutgar,\u201d it\r\ncried. \u201cShow them straight in to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\nThe Story of the Bald-Headed Man\r\n\r\n\r\nWe followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage, ill-lit and\r\nworse furnished, until he came to a door upon the right, which he threw\r\nopen. A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us, and in the centre\r\nof the glare there stood a small man with a very high head, a bristle\r\nof red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shining scalp which\r\nshot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees. He writhed\r\nhis hands together as he stood, and his features were in a perpetual\r\njerk, now smiling, now scowling, but never for an instant in repose.\r\nNature had given him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellow\r\nand irregular teeth, which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly\r\npassing his hand over the lower part of his face. In spite of his\r\nobtrusive baldness, he gave the impression of youth. In point of fact\r\nhe had just turned his thirtieth year.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour servant, Miss Morstan,\u201d he kept repeating, in a thin, high voice.\r\n\u201cYour servant, gentlemen. Pray step into my little sanctum. A small\r\nplace, miss, but furnished to my own liking. An oasis of art in the\r\nhowling desert of South London.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he\r\ninvited us. In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond\r\nof the first water in a setting of brass. The richest and glossiest of\r\ncurtains and tapestries draped the walls, looped back here and there to\r\nexpose some richly-mounted painting or Oriental vase. The carpet was of\r\namber-and-black, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly\r\ninto it, as into a bed of moss. Two great tiger-skins thrown athwart it\r\nincreased the suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge hookah which\r\nstood upon a mat in the corner. A lamp in the fashion of a silver dove\r\nwas hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the\r\nroom. As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odour.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Thaddeus Sholto,\u201d said the little man, still jerking and smiling.\r\n\u201cThat is my name. You are Miss Morstan, of course. And these\r\ngentlemen\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this is Dr. Watson.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA doctor, eh?\u201d cried he, much excited. \u201cHave you your stethoscope?\r\nMight I ask you\u2014would you have the kindness? I have grave doubts as to\r\nmy mitral valve, if you would be so very good. The aortic I may rely\r\nupon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral.\u201d\r\n\r\nI listened to his heart, as requested, but was unable to find anything\r\namiss, save indeed that he was in an ecstasy of fear, for he shivered\r\nfrom head to foot. \u201cIt appears to be normal,\u201d I said. \u201cYou have no\r\ncause for uneasiness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan,\u201d he remarked, airily. \u201cI am\r\na great sufferer, and I have long had suspicions as to that valve. I am\r\ndelighted to hear that they are unwarranted. Had your father, Miss\r\nMorstan, refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart, he might have\r\nbeen alive now.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could have struck the man across the face, so hot was I at this\r\ncallous and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter. Miss Morstan\r\nsat down, and her face grew white to the lips. \u201cI knew in my heart that\r\nhe was dead,\u201d said she.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can give you every information,\u201d said he, \u201cand, what is more, I can\r\ndo you justice; and I will, too, whatever Brother Bartholomew may say.\r\nI am so glad to have your friends here, not only as an escort to you,\r\nbut also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say. The three of us\r\ncan show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew. But let us have no\r\noutsiders,\u2014no police or officials. We can settle everything\r\nsatisfactorily among ourselves, without any interference. Nothing would\r\nannoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity.\u201d He sat down upon a\r\nlow settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak, watery blue\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor my part,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cwhatever you may choose to say will go no\r\nfurther.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded to show my agreement.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is well! That is well!\u201d said he. \u201cMay I offer you a glass of\r\nChianti, Miss Morstan? Or of Tokay? I keep no other wines. Shall I open\r\na flask? No? Well, then, I trust that you have no objection to\r\ntobacco-smoke, to the mild balsamic odour of the Eastern tobacco. I am\r\na little nervous, and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative.\u201d He\r\napplied a taper to the great bowl, and the smoke bubbled merrily\r\nthrough the rose-water. We sat all three in a semi-circle, with our\r\nheads advanced, and our chins upon our hands, while the strange, jerky\r\nlittle fellow, with his high, shining head, puffed uneasily in the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I first determined to make this communication to you,\u201d said he,\r\n\u201cI might have given you my address, but I feared that you might\r\ndisregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you. I took the\r\nliberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my man\r\nWilliams might be able to see you first. I have complete confidence in\r\nhis discretion, and he had orders, if he were dissatisfied, to proceed\r\nno further in the matter. You will excuse these precautions, but I am a\r\nman of somewhat retiring, and I might even say refined, tastes, and\r\nthere is nothing more un\u00e6sthetic than a policeman. I have a natural\r\nshrinking from all forms of rough materialism. I seldom come in contact\r\nwith the rough crowd. I live, as you see, with some little atmosphere\r\nof elegance around me. I may call myself a patron of the arts. It is my\r\nweakness. The landscape is a genuine Corot, and, though a connoisseur\r\nmight perhaps throw a doubt upon that Salvator Rosa, there cannot be\r\nthe least question about the Bouguereau. I am partial to the modern\r\nFrench school.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse me, Mr. Sholto,\u201d said Miss Morstan, \u201cbut I am here at\r\nyour request to learn something which you desire to tell me. It is very\r\nlate, and I should desire the interview to be as short as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the best it must take some time,\u201d he answered; \u201cfor we shall\r\ncertainly have to go to Norwood and see Brother Bartholomew. We shall\r\nall go and try if we can get the better of Brother Bartholomew. He is\r\nvery angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me.\r\nI had quite high words with him last night. You cannot imagine what a\r\nterrible fellow he is when he is angry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we are to go to Norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at\r\nonce,\u201d I ventured to remark.\r\n\r\nHe laughed until his ears were quite red. \u201cThat would hardly do,\u201d he\r\ncried. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he would say if I brought you in that sudden\r\nway. No, I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each\r\nother. In the first place, I must tell you that there are several\r\npoints in the story of which I am myself ignorant. I can only lay the\r\nfacts before you as far as I know them myself.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy father was, as you may have guessed, Major John Sholto, once of the\r\nIndian army. He retired some eleven years ago, and came to live at\r\nPondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood. He had prospered in India, and\r\nbrought back with him a considerable sum of money, a large collection\r\nof valuable curiosities, and a staff of native servants. With these\r\nadvantages he bought himself a house, and lived in great luxury. My\r\ntwin-brother Bartholomew and I were the only children.\r\n\r\n\u201cI very well remember the sensation which was caused by the\r\ndisappearance of Captain Morstan. We read the details in the papers,\r\nand, knowing that he had been a friend of our father\u2019s, we discussed\r\nthe case freely in his presence. He used to join in our speculations as\r\nto what could have happened. Never for an instant did we suspect that\r\nhe had the whole secret hidden in his own breast,\u2014that of all men he\r\nalone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe did know, however, that some mystery\u2014some positive danger\u2014overhung\r\nour father. He was very fearful of going out alone, and he always\r\nemployed two prize-fighters to act as porters at Pondicherry Lodge.\r\nWilliams, who drove you to-night, was one of them. He was once\r\nlight-weight champion of England. Our father would never tell us what\r\nit was he feared, but he had a most marked aversion to men with wooden\r\nlegs. On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a wooden-legged\r\nman, who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for orders. We\r\nhad to pay a large sum to hush the matter up. My brother and I used to\r\nthink this a mere whim of my father\u2019s, but events have since led us to\r\nchange our opinion.\r\n\r\n\u201cEarly in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great\r\nshock to him. He nearly fainted at the breakfast-table when he opened\r\nit, and from that day he sickened to his death. What was in the letter\r\nwe could never discover, but I could see as he held it that it was\r\nshort and written in a scrawling hand. He had suffered for years from\r\nan enlarged spleen, but he now became rapidly worse, and towards the\r\nend of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope, and that he\r\nwished to make a last communication to us.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and breathing\r\nheavily. He besought us to lock the door and to come upon either side\r\nof the bed. Then, grasping our hands, he made a remarkable statement to\r\nus, in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain. I shall\r\ntry and give it to you in his own very words.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I have only one thing,\u2019 he said, \u2018which weighs upon my mind at this\r\nsupreme moment. It is my treatment of poor Morstan\u2019s orphan. The cursed\r\ngreed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld from\r\nher the treasure, half at least of which should have been hers. And yet\r\nI have made no use of it myself,\u2014so blind and foolish a thing is\r\navarice. The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that I\r\ncould not bear to share it with another. See that chaplet dipped with\r\npearls beside the quinine-bottle. Even that I could not bear to part\r\nwith, although I had got it out with the design of sending it to her.\r\nYou, my sons, will give her a fair share of the Agra treasure. But send\r\nher nothing\u2014not even the chaplet\u2014until I am gone. After all, men have\r\nbeen as bad as this and have recovered.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I will tell you how Morstan died,\u2019 he continued. \u2018He had suffered for\r\nyears from a weak heart, but he concealed it from every one. I alone\r\nknew it. When in India, he and I, through a remarkable chain of\r\ncircumstances, came into possession of a considerable treasure. I\r\nbrought it over to England, and on the night of Morstan\u2019s arrival he\r\ncame straight over here to claim his share. He walked over from the\r\nstation, and was admitted by my faithful old Lal Chowdar, who is now\r\ndead. Morstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division of\r\nthe treasure, and we came to heated words. Morstan had sprung out of\r\nhis chair in a paroxysm of anger, when he suddenly pressed his hand to\r\nhis side, his face turned a dusky hue, and he fell backwards, cutting\r\nhis head against the corner of the treasure-chest. When I stooped over\r\nhim I found, to my horror, that he was dead.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018For a long time I sat half distracted, wondering what I should do. My\r\nfirst impulse was, of course, to call for assistance; but I could not\r\nbut recognise that there was every chance that I would be accused of\r\nhis murder. His death at the moment of a quarrel, and the gash in his\r\nhead, would be black against me. Again, an official inquiry could not\r\nbe made without bringing out some facts about the treasure, which I was\r\nparticularly anxious to keep secret. He had told me that no soul upon\r\nearth knew where he had gone. There seemed to be no necessity why any\r\nsoul ever should know.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I was still pondering over the matter, when, looking up, I saw my\r\nservant, Lal Chowdar, in the doorway. He stole in and bolted the door\r\nbehind him. \u201cDo not fear, Sahib,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one need know that you\r\nhave killed him. Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?\u201d \u201cI did\r\nnot kill him,\u201d said I. Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled. \u201cI heard\r\nit all, Sahib,\u201d said he. \u201cI heard you quarrel, and I heard the blow.\r\nBut my lips are sealed. All are asleep in the house. Let us put him\r\naway together.\u201d That was enough to decide me. If my own servant could\r\nnot believe my innocence, how could I hope to make it good before\r\ntwelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box? Lal Chowdar and I disposed of\r\nthe body that night, and within a few days the London papers were full\r\nof the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan. You will see from\r\nwhat I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter. My fault lies in\r\nthe fact that we concealed not only the body, but also the treasure,\r\nand that I have clung to Morstan\u2019s share as well as to my own. I wish\r\nyou, therefore, to make restitution. Put your ears down to my mouth.\r\nThe treasure is hidden in\u2014\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAt this instant a horrible change came over his expression; his eyes\r\nstared wildly, his jaw dropped, and he yelled, in a voice which I can\r\nnever forget, \u2018Keep him out! For Christ\u2019s sake keep him out!\u2019 We both\r\nstared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed. A\r\nface was looking in at us out of the darkness. We could see the\r\nwhitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass. It was a\r\nbearded, hairy face, with wild cruel eyes and an expression of\r\nconcentrated malevolence. My brother and I rushed towards the window,\r\nbut the man was gone. When we returned to my father his head had\r\ndropped and his pulse had ceased to beat.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe searched the garden that night, but found no sign of the intruder,\r\nsave that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the\r\nflower-bed. But for that one trace, we might have thought that our\r\nimaginations had conjured up that wild, fierce face. We soon, however,\r\nhad another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies\r\nat work all round us. The window of my father\u2019s room was found open in\r\nthe morning, his cupboards and boxes had been rifled, and upon his\r\nchest was fixed a torn piece of paper, with the words \u2018The sign of the\r\nfour\u2019 scrawled across it. What the phrase meant, or who our secret\r\nvisitor may have been, we never knew. As far as we can judge, none of\r\nmy father\u2019s property had been actually stolen, though everything had\r\nbeen turned out. My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar\r\nincident with the fear which haunted my father during his life; but it\r\nis still a complete mystery to us.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe little man stopped to relight his hookah and puffed thoughtfully\r\nfor a few moments. We had all sat absorbed, listening to his\r\nextraordinary narrative. At the short account of her father\u2019s death\r\nMiss Morstan had turned deadly white, and for a moment I feared that\r\nshe was about to faint. She rallied however, on drinking a glass of\r\nwater which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe upon\r\nthe side-table. Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with an\r\nabstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes.\r\nAs I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very day he had\r\ncomplained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life. Here at least was a\r\nproblem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost. Mr. Thaddeus Sholto\r\nlooked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the effect\r\nwhich his story had produced, and then continued between the puffs of\r\nhis overgrown pipe.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy brother and I,\u201d said he, \u201cwere, as you may imagine, much excited as\r\nto the treasure which my father had spoken of. For weeks and for months\r\nwe dug and delved in every part of the garden, without discovering its\r\nwhereabouts. It was maddening to think that the hiding-place was on his\r\nvery lips at the moment that he died. We could judge the splendour of\r\nthe missing riches by the chaplet which he had taken out. Over this\r\nchaplet my brother Bartholomew and I had some little discussion. The\r\npearls were evidently of great value, and he was averse to part with\r\nthem, for, between friends, my brother was himself a little inclined to\r\nmy father\u2019s fault. He thought, too, that if we parted with the chaplet\r\nit might give rise to gossip and finally bring us into trouble. It was\r\nall that I could do to persuade him to let me find out Miss Morstan\u2019s\r\naddress and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals, so that at\r\nleast she might never feel destitute.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a kindly thought,\u201d said our companion, earnestly. \u201cIt was\r\nextremely good of you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe little man waved his hand deprecatingly. \u201cWe were your trustees,\u201d\r\nhe said. \u201cThat was the view which I took of it, though Brother\r\nBartholomew could not altogether see it in that light. We had plenty of\r\nmoney ourselves. I desired no more. Besides, it would have been such\r\nbad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion. \u2018Le\r\nmauvais go\u00fbt m\u00e8ne au crime.\u2019 The French have a very neat way of putting\r\nthese things. Our difference of opinion on this subject went so far\r\nthat I thought it best to set up rooms for myself: so I left\r\nPondicherry Lodge, taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me.\r\nYesterday, however, I learn that an event of extreme importance has\r\noccurred. The treasure has been discovered. I instantly communicated\r\nwith Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood\r\nand demand our share. I explained my views last night to Brother\r\nBartholomew: so we shall be expected, if not welcome, visitors.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased, and sat twitching on his luxurious settee.\r\nWe all remained silent, with our thoughts upon the new development\r\nwhich the mysterious business had taken. Holmes was the first to spring\r\nto his feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have done well, sir, from first to last,\u201d said he. \u201cIt is possible\r\nthat we may be able to make you some small return by throwing some\r\nlight upon that which is still dark to you. But, as Miss Morstan\r\nremarked just now, it is late, and we had best put the matter through\r\nwithout delay.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his\r\nhookah, and produced from behind a curtain a very long befrogged\r\ntopcoat with Astrakhan collar and cuffs. This he buttoned tightly up,\r\nin spite of the extreme closeness of the night, and finished his attire\r\nby putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which covered the\r\nears, so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky\r\nface. \u201cMy health is somewhat fragile,\u201d he remarked, as he led the way\r\ndown the passage. \u201cI am compelled to be a valetudinarian.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur cab was awaiting us outside, and our programme was evidently\r\nprearranged, for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace.\r\nThaddeus Sholto talked incessantly, in a voice which rose high above\r\nthe rattle of the wheels.\r\n\r\n\u201cBartholomew is a clever fellow,\u201d said he. \u201cHow do you think he found\r\nout where the treasure was? He had come to the conclusion that it was\r\nsomewhere indoors: so he worked out all the cubic space of the house,\r\nand made measurements everywhere, so that not one inch should be\r\nunaccounted for. Among other things, he found that the height of the\r\nbuilding was seventy-four feet, but on adding together the heights of\r\nall the separate rooms, and making every allowance for the space\r\nbetween, which he ascertained by borings, he could not bring the total\r\nto more than seventy feet. There were four feet unaccounted for. These\r\ncould only be at the top of the building. He knocked a hole, therefore,\r\nin the lath-and-plaster ceiling of the highest room, and there, sure\r\nenough, he came upon another little garret above it, which had been\r\nsealed up and was known to no one. In the centre stood the\r\ntreasure-chest, resting upon two rafters. He lowered it through the\r\nhole, and there it lies. He computes the value of the jewels at not\r\nless than half a million sterling.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another\r\nopen-eyed. Miss Morstan, could we secure her rights, would change from\r\na needy governess to the richest heiress in England. Surely it was the\r\nplace of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news; yet I am ashamed to\r\nsay that selfishness took me by the soul, and that my heart turned as\r\nheavy as lead within me. I stammered out some few halting words of\r\ncongratulation, and then sat downcast, with my head drooped, deaf to\r\nthe babble of our new acquaintance. He was clearly a confirmed\r\nhypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth\r\ninterminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to the\r\ncomposition and action of innumerable quack nostrums, some of which he\r\nbore about in a leather case in his pocket. I trust that he may not\r\nremember any of the answers which I gave him that night. Holmes\r\ndeclares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of\r\ntaking more than two drops of castor oil, while I recommended\r\nstrychnine in large doses as a sedative. However that may be, I was\r\ncertainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman\r\nsprang down to open the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis, Miss Morstan, is Pondicherry Lodge,\u201d said Mr. Thaddeus Sholto,\r\nas he handed her out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\nThe Tragedy of Pondicherry Lodge\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was nearly eleven o\u2019clock when we reached this final stage of our\r\nnight\u2019s adventures. We had left the damp fog of the great city behind\r\nus, and the night was fairly fine. A warm wind blew from the westward,\r\nand heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping\r\noccasionally through the rifts. It was clear enough to see for some\r\ndistance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side-lamps from the\r\ncarriage to give us a better light upon our way.\r\n\r\nPondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds, and was girt round with a\r\nvery high stone wall topped with broken glass. A single narrow\r\niron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance. On this our guide\r\nknocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is there?\u201d cried a gruff voice from within.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is I, McMurdo. You surely know my knock by this time.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys. The\r\ndoor swung heavily back, and a short, deep-chested man stood in the\r\nopening, with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his\r\nprotruded face and twinkling distrustful eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat you, Mr. Thaddeus? But who are the others? I had no orders about\r\nthem from the master.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, McMurdo? You surprise me! I told my brother last night that I\r\nshould bring some friends.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe ain\u2019t been out o\u2019 his room to-day, Mr. Thaddeus, and I have no\r\norders. You know very well that I must stick to regulations. I can let\r\nyou in, but your friends must just stop where they are.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was an unexpected obstacle. Thaddeus Sholto looked about him in a\r\nperplexed and helpless manner. \u201cThis is too bad of you, McMurdo!\u201d he\r\nsaid. \u201cIf I guarantee them, that is enough for you. There is the young\r\nlady, too. She cannot wait on the public road at this hour.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery sorry, Mr. Thaddeus,\u201d said the porter, inexorably. \u201cFolk may be\r\nfriends o\u2019 yours, and yet no friends o\u2019 the master\u2019s. He pays me well\r\nto do my duty, and my duty I\u2019ll do. I don\u2019t know none o\u2019 your friends.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes you do, McMurdo,\u201d cried Sherlock Holmes, genially. \u201cI don\u2019t\r\nthink you can have forgotten me. Don\u2019t you remember the amateur who\r\nfought three rounds with you at Alison\u2019s rooms on the night of your\r\nbenefit four years back?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\u201d roared the prize-fighter. \u201cGod\u2019s truth! how\r\ncould I have mistook you? If instead o\u2019 standin\u2019 there so quiet you had\r\njust stepped up and given me that cross-hit of yours under the jaw, I\u2019d\r\nha\u2019 known you without a question. Ah, you\u2019re one that has wasted your\r\ngifts, you have! You might have aimed high, if you had joined the\r\nfancy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, Watson, if all else fails me I have still one of the\r\nscientific professions open to me,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cOur friend\r\nwon\u2019t keep us out in the cold now, I am sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn you come, sir, in you come,\u2014you and your friends,\u201d he answered.\r\n\u201cVery sorry, Mr. Thaddeus, but orders are very strict. Had to be\r\ncertain of your friends before I let them in.\u201d\r\n\r\nInside, a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of\r\na house, square and prosaic, all plunged in shadow save where a\r\nmoonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window. The vast\r\nsize of the building, with its gloom and its deathly silence, struck a\r\nchill to the heart. Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease, and the\r\nlantern quivered and rattled in his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot understand it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere must be some mistake. I\r\ndistinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here, and yet there is no\r\nlight in his window. I do not know what to make of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes he always guard the premises in this way?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; he has followed my father\u2019s custom. He was the favourite son, you\r\nknow, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than\r\nhe ever told me. That is Bartholomew\u2019s window up there where the\r\nmoonshine strikes. It is quite bright, but there is no light from\r\nwithin, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cBut I see the glint of a light in that little\r\nwindow beside the door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that is the housekeeper\u2019s room. That is where old Mrs. Bernstone\r\nsits. She can tell us all about it. But perhaps you would not mind\r\nwaiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together and she\r\nhas no word of our coming she may be alarmed. But hush! what is that?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held up the lantern, and his hand shook until the circles of light\r\nflickered and wavered all round us. Miss Morstan seized my wrist, and\r\nwe all stood with thumping hearts, straining our ears. From the great\r\nblack house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most\r\npitiful of sounds,\u2014the shrill, broken whimpering of a frightened woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is Mrs. Bernstone,\u201d said Sholto. \u201cShe is the only woman in the\r\nhouse. Wait here. I shall be back in a moment.\u201d He hurried for the\r\ndoor, and knocked in his peculiar way. We could see a tall old woman\r\nadmit him, and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have come! I am so glad you\r\nhave come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!\u201d We heard her reiterated rejoicings until\r\nthe door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone.\r\n\r\nOur guide had left us the lantern. Holmes swung it slowly round, and\r\npeered keenly at the house, and at the great rubbish-heaps which\r\ncumbered the grounds. Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her hand\r\nwas in mine. A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two who\r\nhad never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even\r\nlook of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble\r\nour hands instinctively sought for each other. I have marvelled at it\r\nsince, but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should\r\ngo out to her so, and, as she has often told me, there was in her also\r\nthe instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection. So we stood hand\r\nin hand, like two children, and there was peace in our hearts for all\r\nthe dark things that surrounded us.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a strange place!\u201d she said, looking round.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose in it.\r\nI have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat,\r\nwhere the prospectors had been at work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd from the same cause,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThese are the traces of the\r\ntreasure-seekers. You must remember that they were six years looking\r\nfor it. No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt that moment the door of the house burst open, and Thaddeus Sholto\r\ncame running out, with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is something amiss with Bartholomew!\u201d he cried. \u201cI am\r\nfrightened! My nerves cannot stand it.\u201d He was, indeed, half blubbering\r\nwith fear, and his twitching feeble face peeping out from the great\r\nAstrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a terrified\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome into the house,\u201d said Holmes, in his crisp, firm way.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, do!\u201d pleaded Thaddeus Sholto. \u201cI really do not feel equal to\r\ngiving directions.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe all followed him into the housekeeper\u2019s room, which stood upon the\r\nleft-hand side of the passage. The old woman was pacing up and down\r\nwith a scared look and restless picking fingers, but the sight of Miss\r\nMorstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod bless your sweet calm face!\u201d she cried, with an hysterical sob.\r\n\u201cIt does me good to see you. Oh, but I have been sorely tried this\r\nday!\u201d\r\n\r\nOur companion patted her thin, work-worn hand, and murmured some few\r\nwords of kindly womanly comfort which brought the colour back into the\r\nother\u2019s bloodless cheeks.\r\n\r\n\u201cMaster has locked himself in and will not answer me,\u201d she explained.\r\n\u201cAll day I have waited to hear from him, for he often likes to be\r\nalone; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so I went up\r\nand peeped through the key-hole. You must go up, Mr. Thaddeus,\u2014you must\r\ngo up and look for yourself. I have seen Mr. Bartholomew Sholto in joy\r\nand in sorrow for ten long years, but I never saw him with such a face\r\non him as that.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto\u2019s\r\nteeth were chattering in his head. So shaken was he that I had to pass\r\nmy hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees were\r\ntrembling under him. Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens out\r\nof his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be\r\nmere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting which served\r\nas a stair-carpet. He walked slowly from step to step, holding the\r\nlamp, and shooting keen glances to right and left. Miss Morstan had\r\nremained behind with the frightened housekeeper.\r\n\r\nThe third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length,\r\nwith a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three\r\ndoors upon the left. Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and\r\nmethodical way, while we kept close at his heels, with our long black\r\nshadows streaming backwards down the corridor. The third door was that\r\nwhich we were seeking. Holmes knocked without receiving any answer, and\r\nthen tried to turn the handle and force it open. It was locked on the\r\ninside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt, as we could see when\r\nwe set our lamp up against it. The key being turned, however, the hole\r\nwas not entirely closed. Sherlock Holmes bent down to it, and instantly\r\nrose again with a sharp intaking of the breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is something devilish in this, Watson,\u201d said he, more moved than\r\nI had ever before seen him. \u201cWhat do you make of it?\u201d\r\n\r\nI stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror. Moonlight was streaming\r\ninto the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance.\r\nLooking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the air, for all\r\nbeneath was in shadow, there hung a face,\u2014the very face of our\r\ncompanion Thaddeus. There was the same high, shining head, the same\r\ncircular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless countenance. The\r\nfeatures were set, however, in a horrible smile, a fixed and unnatural\r\ngrin, which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the\r\nnerves than any scowl or contortion. So like was the face to that of\r\nour little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was\r\nindeed with us. Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us\r\nthat his brother and he were twins.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is terrible!\u201d I said to Holmes. \u201cWhat is to be done?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe door must come down,\u201d he answered, and, springing against it, he\r\nput all his weight upon the lock. It creaked and groaned, but did not\r\nyield. Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time it\r\ngave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within Bartholomew\r\nSholto\u2019s chamber.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory. A double\r\nline of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the\r\ndoor, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners, test-tubes,\r\nand retorts. In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets.\r\nOne of these appeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream of\r\ndark-coloured liquid had trickled out from it, and the air was heavy\r\nwith a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odour. A set of steps stood at one\r\nside of the room, in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster, and\r\nabove them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man\r\nto pass through. At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was\r\nthrown carelessly together.\r\n\r\nBy the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was seated\r\nall in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and that\r\nghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face. He was stiff and cold, and\r\nhad clearly been dead many hours. It seemed to me that not only his\r\nfeatures but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most\r\nfantastic fashion. By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar\r\ninstrument,\u2014a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a\r\nhammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine. Beside it was a torn sheet\r\nof note-paper with some words scrawled upon it. Holmes glanced at it,\r\nand then handed it to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d he said, with a significant raising of the eyebrows.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, \u201cThe sign\r\nof the four.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn God\u2019s name, what does it all mean?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt means murder,\u201d said he, stooping over the dead man. \u201cAh, I expected\r\nit. Look here!\u201d He pointed to what looked like a long, dark thorn stuck\r\nin the skin just above the ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks like a thorn,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a thorn. You may pick it out. But be careful, for it is\r\npoisoned.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took it up between my finger and thumb. It came away from the skin so\r\nreadily that hardly any mark was left behind. One tiny speck of blood\r\nshowed where the puncture had been.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is all an insoluble mystery to me,\u201d said I. \u201cIt grows darker\r\ninstead of clearer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d he answered, \u201cit clears every instant. I only\r\nrequire a few missing links to have an entirely connected case.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had almost forgotten our companion\u2019s presence since we entered the\r\nchamber. He was still standing in the doorway, the very picture of\r\nterror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself. Suddenly, however,\r\nhe broke out into a sharp, querulous cry.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe treasure is gone!\u201d he said. \u201cThey have robbed him of the treasure!\r\nThere is the hole through which we lowered it. I helped him to do it! I\r\nwas the last person who saw him! I left him here last night, and I\r\nheard him lock the door as I came downstairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat time was that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was ten o\u2019clock. And now he is dead, and the police will be called\r\nin, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I am\r\nsure I shall. But you don\u2019t think so, gentlemen? Surely you don\u2019t think\r\nthat it was I? Is it likely that I would have brought you here if it\r\nwere I? Oh, dear! oh, dear! I know that I shall go mad!\u201d He jerked his\r\narms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto,\u201d said Holmes, kindly, putting\r\nhis hand upon his shoulder. \u201cTake my advice, and drive down to the\r\nstation to report this matter to the police. Offer to assist them in\r\nevery way. We shall wait here until your return.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him\r\nstumbling down the stairs in the dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\nSherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, rubbing his hands, \u201cwe have half an hour to\r\nourselves. Let us make good use of it. My case is, as I have told you,\r\nalmost complete; but we must not err on the side of over-confidence.\r\nSimple as the case seems now, there may be something deeper underlying\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSimple!\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely,\u201d said he, with something of the air of a clinical professor\r\nexpounding to his class. \u201cJust sit in the corner there, that your\r\nfootprints may not complicate matters. Now to work! In the first place,\r\nhow did these folk come, and how did they go? The door has not been\r\nopened since last night. How of the window?\u201d He carried the lamp across\r\nto it, muttering his observations aloud the while, but addressing them\r\nto himself rather than to me. \u201cWindow is snibbed on the inner side.\r\nFramework is solid. No hinges at the side. Let us open it. No\r\nwater-pipe near. Roof quite out of reach. Yet a man has mounted by the\r\nwindow. It rained a little last night. Here is the print of a foot in\r\nmould upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy mark, and here again\r\nupon the floor, and here again by the table. See here, Watson! This is\r\nreally a very pretty demonstration.\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs. \u201cThis is not a\r\nfootmark,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of a\r\nwooden stump. You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot\r\nwith the broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the\r\ntimber-toe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is the wooden-legged man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. But there has been some one else,\u2014a very able and efficient\r\nally. Could you scale that wall, doctor?\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked out of the open window. The moon still shone brightly on that\r\nangle of the house. We were a good sixty feet from the ground, and,\r\nlook where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as a crevice\r\nin the brick-work.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is absolutely impossible,\u201d I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout aid it is so. But suppose you had a friend up here who lowered\r\nyou this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing one end of\r\nit to this great hook in the wall. Then, I think, if you were an active\r\nman, You might swarm up, wooden leg and all. You would depart, of\r\ncourse, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up the rope,\r\nuntie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the inside, and get\r\naway in the way that he originally came. As a minor point it may be\r\nnoted,\u201d he continued, fingering the rope, \u201cthat our wooden-legged\r\nfriend, though a fair climber, was not a professional sailor. His hands\r\nwere far from horny. My lens discloses more than one blood-mark,\r\nespecially towards the end of the rope, from which I gather that he\r\nslipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is all very well,\u201d said I, \u201cbut the thing becomes more\r\nunintelligible than ever. How about this mysterious ally? How came he\r\ninto the room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the ally!\u201d repeated Holmes, pensively. \u201cThere are features of\r\ninterest about this ally. He lifts the case from the regions of the\r\ncommonplace. I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals\r\nof crime in this country,\u2014though parallel cases suggest themselves from\r\nIndia, and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow came he, then?\u201d I reiterated. \u201cThe door is locked, the window is\r\ninaccessible. Was it through the chimney?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe grate is much too small,\u201d he answered. \u201cI had already considered\r\nthat possibility.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow then?\u201d I persisted.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not apply my precept,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cHow often\r\nhave I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible\r\nwhatever remains, _however improbable_, must be the truth? We know that\r\nhe did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. We also\r\nknow that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is no\r\nconcealment possible. Whence, then, did he come?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe came through the hole in the roof,\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course he did. He must have done so. If you will have the kindness\r\nto hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researches to the room\r\nabove,\u2014the secret room in which the treasure was found.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with either hand, he swung\r\nhimself up into the garret. Then, lying on his face, he reached down\r\nfor the lamp and held it while I followed him.\r\n\r\nThe chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and\r\nsix the other. The floor was formed by the rafters, with thin\r\nlath-and-plaster between, so that in walking one had to step from beam\r\nto beam. The roof ran up to an apex, and was evidently the inner shell\r\nof the true roof of the house. There was no furniture of any sort, and\r\nthe accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere you are, you see,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, putting his hand against\r\nthe sloping wall. \u201cThis is a trap-door which leads out on to the roof.\r\nI can press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping at a gentle\r\nangle. This, then, is the way by which Number One entered. Let us see\r\nif we can find any other traces of his individuality.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held down the lamp to the floor, and as he did so I saw for the\r\nsecond time that night a startled, surprised look come over his face.\r\nFor myself, as I followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes.\r\nThe floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot,\u2014clear,\r\nwell defined, perfectly formed, but scarce half the size of those of an\r\nordinary man.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I said, in a whisper, \u201ca child has done the horrid thing.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had recovered his self-possession in an instant. \u201cI was staggered\r\nfor the moment,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the thing is quite natural. My memory\r\nfailed me, or I should have been able to foretell it. There is nothing\r\nmore to be learned here. Let us go down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?\u201d I asked, eagerly,\r\nwhen we had regained the lower room once more.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself,\u201d said he, with a touch\r\nof impatience. \u201cYou know my methods. Apply them, and it will be\r\ninstructive to compare results.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts,\u201d I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will be clear enough to you soon,\u201d he said, in an off-hand way. \u201cI\r\nthink that there is nothing else of importance here, but I will look.\u201d\r\nHe whipped out his lens and a tape measure, and hurried about the room\r\non his knees, measuring, comparing, examining, with his long thin nose\r\nonly a few inches from the planks, and his beady eyes gleaming and\r\ndeep-set like those of a bird. So swift, silent, and furtive were his\r\nmovements, like those of a trained blood-hound picking out a scent,\r\nthat I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made\r\nhad he turned his energy and sagacity against the law, instead of\r\nexerting them in its defence. As he hunted about, he kept muttering to\r\nhimself, and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are certainly in luck,\u201d said he. \u201cWe ought to have very little\r\ntrouble now. Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the\r\ncreosote. You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at\r\nthe side of this evil-smelling mess. The carboy has been cracked, You\r\nsee, and the stuff has leaked out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, we have got him, that\u2019s all,\u201d said he. \u201cI know a dog that would\r\nfollow that scent to the world\u2019s end. If a pack can track a trailed\r\nherring across a shire, how far can a specially-trained hound follow so\r\npungent a smell as this? It sounds like a sum in the rule of three. The\r\nanswer should give us the\u2014But halloa! here are the accredited\r\nrepresentatives of the law.\u201d\r\n\r\nHeavy steps and the clamour of loud voices were audible from below, and\r\nthe hall door shut with a loud crash.\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore they come,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cjust put your hand here on this poor\r\nfellow\u2019s arm, and here on his leg. What do you feel?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe muscles are as hard as a board,\u201d I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceeding\r\nthe usual _rigor mortis_. Coupled with this distortion of the face,\r\nthis Hippocratic smile, or \u2018_risus sardonicus_,\u2019 as the old writers\r\ncalled it, what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDeath from some powerful vegetable alkaloid,\u201d I answered,\u2014\u201csome\r\nstrychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn\r\nmuscles of the face. On getting into the room I at once looked for the\r\nmeans by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, I\r\ndiscovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force\r\ninto the scalp. You observe that the part struck was that which would\r\nbe turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his\r\nchair. Now examine the thorn.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. It was\r\nlong, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as though\r\nsome gummy substance had dried upon it. The blunt end had been trimmed\r\nand rounded off with a knife.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that an English thorn?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it certainly is not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith all these data you should be able to draw some just inference.\r\nBut here are the regulars; so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on\r\nthe passage, and a very stout, portly man in a grey suit strode heavily\r\ninto the room. He was red-faced, burly and plethoric, with a pair of\r\nvery small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen\r\nand puffy pouches. He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform,\r\nand by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s a business!\u201d he cried, in a muffled, husky voice. \u201cHere\u2019s a\r\npretty business! But who are all these? Why, the house seems to be as\r\nfull as a rabbit-warren!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones,\u201d said Holmes,\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, of course I do!\u201d he wheezed. \u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the\r\ntheorist. Remember you! I\u2019ll never forget how you lectured us all on\r\ncauses and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case. It\u2019s\r\ntrue you set us on the right track; but you\u2019ll own now that it was more\r\nby good luck than good guidance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a piece of very simple reasoning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, come, now, come! Never be ashamed to own up. But what is all this?\r\nBad business! Bad business! Stern facts here,\u2014no room for theories. How\r\nlucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another case! I was at\r\nthe station when the message arrived. What d\u2019you think the man died\r\nof?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, this is hardly a case for me to theorise over,\u201d said Holmes,\r\ndryly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no. Still, we can\u2019t deny that you hit the nail on the head\r\nsometimes. Dear me! Door locked, I understand. Jewels worth half a\r\nmillion missing. How was the window?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFastened; but there are steps on the sill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with\r\nthe matter. That\u2019s common sense. Man might have died in a fit; but then\r\nthe jewels are missing. Ha! I have a theory. These flashes come upon me\r\nat times.\u2014Just step outside, sergeant, and you, Mr. Sholto. Your friend\r\ncan remain.\u2014What do you think of this, Holmes? Sholto was, on his own\r\nconfession, with his brother last night. The brother died in a fit, on\r\nwhich Sholto walked off with the treasure. How\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on\r\nthe inside.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum! There\u2019s a flaw there. Let us apply common sense to the matter.\r\nThis Thaddeus Sholto _was_ with his brother; there _was_ a quarrel; so\r\nmuch we know. The brother is dead and the jewels are gone. So much also\r\nwe know. No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him. His\r\nbed had not been slept in. Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed\r\nstate of mind. His appearance is\u2014well, not attractive. You see that I\r\nam weaving my web round Thaddeus. The net begins to close upon him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not quite in possession of the facts yet,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis\r\nsplinter of wood, which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned,\r\nwas in the man\u2019s scalp where you still see the mark; this card,\r\ninscribed as you see it, was on the table; and beside it lay this\r\nrather curious stone-headed instrument. How does all that fit into your\r\ntheory?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cConfirms it in every respect,\u201d said the fat detective, pompously.\r\n\u201cHouse is full of Indian curiosities. Thaddeus brought this up, and if\r\nthis splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use\r\nof it as any other man. The card is some hocus-pocus,\u2014a blind, as like\r\nas not. The only question is, how did he depart? Ah, of course, here is\r\na hole in the roof.\u201d With great activity, considering his bulk, he\r\nsprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret, and\r\nimmediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he\r\nhad found the trap-door.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe can find something,\u201d remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cHe\r\nhas occasional glimmerings of reason. _Il n\u2019y a pas des sots si\r\nincommodes que ceux qui ont de l\u2019esprit!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see!\u201d said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again.\r\n\u201cFacts are better than mere theories, after all. My view of the case is\r\nconfirmed. There is a trap-door communicating with the roof, and it is\r\npartly open.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was I who opened it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed! You did notice it, then?\u201d He seemed a little crestfallen\r\nat the discovery. \u201cWell, whoever noticed it, it shows how our gentleman\r\ngot away. Inspector!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d from the passage.\r\n\r\n\u201cAsk Mr. Sholto to step this way.\u2014Mr. Sholto, it is my duty to inform\r\nyou that anything which you may say will be used against you. I arrest\r\nyou in the Queen\u2019s name as being concerned in the death of your\r\nbrother.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, now! Didn\u2019t I tell you!\u201d cried the poor little man, throwing\r\nout his hands, and looking from one to the other of us.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI think\r\nthat I can engage to clear you of the charge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t promise too much, Mr. Theorist,\u2014don\u2019t promise too much!\u201d snapped\r\nthe detective. \u201cYou may find it a harder matter than you think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a free\r\npresent of the name and description of one of the two people who were\r\nin this room last night. His name, I have every reason to believe, is\r\nJonathan Small. He is a poorly-educated man, small, active, with his\r\nright leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the\r\ninner side. His left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole, with an iron\r\nband round the heel. He is a middle-aged man, much sunburned, and has\r\nbeen a convict. These few indications may be of some assistance to you,\r\ncoupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from\r\nthe palm of his hand. The other man\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! the other man\u2014?\u201d asked Athelney Jones, in a sneering voice, but\r\nimpressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of the\r\nother\u2019s manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs a rather curious person,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his\r\nheel. \u201cI hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair\r\nof them.\u2014A word with you, Watson.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe led me out to the head of the stair. \u201cThis unexpected occurrence,\u201d\r\nhe said, \u201chas caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of\r\nour journey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have just been thinking so,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt is not right that Miss\r\nMorstan should remain in this stricken house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. You must escort her home. She lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester, in\r\nLower Camberwell: so it is not very far. I will wait for you here if\r\nyou will drive out again. Or perhaps you are too tired?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy no means. I don\u2019t think I could rest until I know more of this\r\nfantastic business. I have seen something of the rough side of life,\r\nbut I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises\r\nto-night has shaken my nerve completely. I should like, however, to see\r\nthe matter through with you, now that I have got so far.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour presence will be of great service to me,\u201d he answered. \u201cWe shall\r\nwork the case out independently, and leave this fellow Jones to exult\r\nover any mare\u2019s-nest which he may choose to construct. When you have\r\ndropped Miss Morstan I wish you to go on to No. 3, Pinchin Lane, down\r\nnear the water\u2019s edge at Lambeth. The third house on the right-hand\r\nside is a bird-stuffer\u2019s: Sherman is the name. You will see a weasel\r\nholding a young rabbit in the window. Knock old Sherman up, and tell\r\nhim, with my compliments, that I want Toby at once. You will bring Toby\r\nback in the cab with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA dog, I suppose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u2014a queer mongrel, with a most amazing power of scent. I would\r\nrather have Toby\u2019s help than that of the whole detective force of\r\nLondon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall bring him, then,\u201d said I. \u201cIt is one now. I ought to be back\r\nbefore three, if I can get a fresh horse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cshall see what I can learn from Mrs. Bernstone,\r\nand from the Indian servant, who, Mr. Thaddeus tell me, sleeps in the\r\nnext garret. Then I shall study the great Jones\u2019s methods and listen to\r\nhis not too delicate sarcasms. \u2018_Wir sind gewohnt das die Menschen\r\nverh\u00f6hnen was sie nicht verstehen._\u2019 Goethe is always pithy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\nThe Episode of the Barrel\r\n\r\n\r\nThe police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss\r\nMorstan back to her home. After the angelic fashion of women, she had\r\nborne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker\r\nthan herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the\r\nside of the frightened housekeeper. In the cab, however, she first\r\nturned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping,\u2014so sorely had\r\nshe been tried by the adventures of the night. She has told me since\r\nthat she thought me cold and distant upon that journey. She little\r\nguessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraint\r\nwhich held me back. My sympathies and my love went out to her, even as\r\nmy hand had in the garden. I felt that years of the conventionalities\r\nof life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had this\r\none day of strange experiences. Yet there were two thoughts which\r\nsealed the words of affection upon my lips. She was weak and helpless,\r\nshaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a disadvantage to\r\nobtrude love upon her at such a time. Worse still, she was rich. If\r\nHolmes\u2019s researches were successful, she would be an heiress. Was it\r\nfair, was it honourable, that a half-pay surgeon should take such\r\nadvantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about? Might she not\r\nlook upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker? I could not bear to risk\r\nthat such a thought should cross her mind. This Agra treasure\r\nintervened like an impassable barrier between us.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly two o\u2019clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester\u2019s. The\r\nservants had retired hours ago, but Mrs. Forrester had been so\r\ninterested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received that\r\nshe had sat up in the hope of her return. She opened the door herself,\r\na middle-aged, graceful woman, and it gave me joy to see how tenderly\r\nher arm stole round the other\u2019s waist and how motherly was the voice in\r\nwhich she greeted her. She was clearly no mere paid dependant, but an\r\nhonoured friend. I was introduced, and Mrs. Forrester earnestly begged\r\nme to step in and tell her our adventures. I explained, however, the\r\nimportance of my errand, and promised faithfully to call and report any\r\nprogress which we might make with the case. As we drove away I stole a\r\nglance back, and I still seem to see that little group on the step, the\r\ntwo graceful, clinging figures, the half-opened door, the hall-light\r\nshining through stained glass, the barometer, and the bright\r\nstair-rods. It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a\r\ntranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which had\r\nabsorbed us.\r\n\r\nAnd the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker it\r\ngrew. I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I\r\nrattled on through the silent gas-lit streets. There was the original\r\nproblem: that at least was pretty clear now. The death of Captain\r\nMorstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter,\u2014we\r\nhad had light upon all those events. They had only led us, however, to\r\na deeper and far more tragic mystery. The Indian treasure, the curious\r\nplan found among Morstan\u2019s baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto\u2019s\r\ndeath, the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the\r\nmurder of the discoverer, the very singular accompaniments to the\r\ncrime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card,\r\ncorresponding with those upon Captain Morstan\u2019s chart,\u2014here was indeed\r\na labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my\r\nfellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue.\r\n\r\nPinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in the lower\r\nquarter of Lambeth. I had to knock for some time at No. 3 before I\r\ncould make my impression. At last, however, there was the glint of a\r\ncandle behind the blind, and a face looked out at the upper window.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on, you drunken vagabone,\u201d said the face. \u201cIf you kick up any more\r\nrow I\u2019ll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs upon you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll let one out it\u2019s just what I have come for,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on!\u201d yelled the voice. \u201cSo help me gracious, I have a wiper in the\r\nbag, an\u2019 I\u2019ll drop it on your \u2019ead if you don\u2019t hook it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I want a dog,\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t be argued with!\u201d shouted Mr. Sherman. \u201cNow stand clear, for\r\nwhen I say \u2018three,\u2019 down goes the wiper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Sherlock Holmes\u2014\u201d I began, but the words had a most magical\r\neffect, for the window instantly slammed down, and within a minute the\r\ndoor was unbarred and open. Mr. Sherman was a lanky, lean old man, with\r\nstooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tinted glasses.\r\n\r\n\u201cA friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome,\u201d said he. \u201cStep in, sir.\r\nKeep clear of the badger; for he bites. Ah, naughty, naughty, would you\r\ntake a nip at the gentleman?\u201d This to a stoat which thrust its wicked\r\nhead and red eyes between the bars of its cage. \u201cDon\u2019t mind that, sir:\r\nit\u2019s only a slow-worm. It hain\u2019t got no fangs, so I gives it the run o\u2019\r\nthe room, for it keeps the beetles down. You must not mind my bein\u2019\r\njust a little short wi\u2019 you at first, for I\u2019m guyed at by the children,\r\nand there\u2019s many a one just comes down this lane to knock me up. What\r\nwas it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe wanted a dog of yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! that would be Toby.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Toby was the name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cToby lives at No. 7 on the left here.\u201d He moved slowly forward with\r\nhis candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round\r\nhim. In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that there were\r\nglancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and\r\ncorner. Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls,\r\nwho lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices\r\ndisturbed their slumbers.\r\n\r\nToby proved to be an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared creature, half\r\nspaniel and half lurcher, brown-and-white in colour, with a very clumsy\r\nwaddling gait. It accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar which\r\nthe old naturalist handed to me, and, having thus sealed an alliance,\r\nit followed me to the cab, and made no difficulties about accompanying\r\nme. It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself\r\nback once more at Pondicherry Lodge. The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had,\r\nI found, been arrested as an accessory, and both he and Mr. Sholto had\r\nbeen marched off to the station. Two constables guarded the narrow\r\ngate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the\r\ndetective\u2019s name.\r\n\r\nHolmes was standing on the door-step, with his hands in his pockets,\r\nsmoking his pipe.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, you have him there!\u201d said he. \u201cGood dog, then! Athelney Jones has\r\ngone. We have had an immense display of energy since you left. He has\r\narrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the gatekeeper, the housekeeper,\r\nand the Indian servant. We have the place to ourselves, but for a\r\nsergeant upstairs. Leave the dog here, and come up.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe tied Toby to the hall table, and re-ascended the stairs. The room\r\nwas as he had left it, save that a sheet had been draped over the\r\ncentral figure. A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner.\r\n\r\n\u201cLend me your bull\u2019s-eye, sergeant,\u201d said my companion. \u201cNow tie this\r\nbit of card round my neck, so as to hang it in front of me. Thank you.\r\nNow I must kick off my boots and stockings.\u2014Just you carry them down\r\nwith you, Watson. I am going to do a little climbing. And dip my\r\nhandkerchief into the creasote. That will do. Now come up into the\r\ngarret with me for a moment.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe clambered up through the hole. Holmes turned his light once more\r\nupon the footsteps in the dust.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish you particularly to notice these footmarks,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you\r\nobserve anything noteworthy about them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey belong,\u201d I said, \u201cto a child or a small woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cApart from their size, though. Is there nothing else?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey appear to be much as other footmarks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. Look here! This is the print of a right foot in the dust.\r\nNow I make one with my naked foot beside it. What is the chief\r\ndifference?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour toes are all cramped together. The other print has each toe\r\ndistinctly divided.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. That is the point. Bear that in mind. Now, would you kindly\r\nstep over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the wood-work? I\r\nshall stay here, as I have this handkerchief in my hand.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did as he directed, and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry\r\nsmell.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is where he put his foot in getting out. If _you_ can trace him,\r\nI should think that Toby will have no difficulty. Now run downstairs,\r\nloose the dog, and look out for Blondin.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was on the\r\nroof, and I could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawling very\r\nslowly along the ridge. I lost sight of him behind a stack of chimneys,\r\nbut he presently reappeared, and then vanished once more upon the\r\nopposite side. When I made my way round there I found him seated at one\r\nof the corner eaves.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat you, Watson?\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the place. What is that black thing down there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA water-barrel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTop on it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo sign of a ladder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cConfound the fellow! It\u2019s a most break-neck place. I ought to be able\r\nto come down where he could climb up. The water-pipe feels pretty firm.\r\nHere goes, anyhow.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a scuffling of feet, and the lantern began to come steadily\r\ndown the side of the wall. Then with a light spring he came on to the\r\nbarrel, and from there to the earth.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was easy to follow him,\u201d he said, drawing on his stockings and\r\nboots. \u201cTiles were loosened the whole way along, and in his hurry he\r\nhad dropped this. It confirms my diagnosis, as you doctors express it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out\r\nof coloured grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it. In\r\nshape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case. Inside were half a\r\ndozen spines of dark wood, sharp at one end and rounded at the other,\r\nlike that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are hellish things,\u201d said he. \u201cLook out that you don\u2019t prick\r\nyourself. I\u2019m delighted to have them, for the chances are that they are\r\nall he has. There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skin\r\nbefore long. I would sooner face a Martini bullet, myself. Are you game\r\nfor a six-mile trudge, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour leg will stand it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere you are, doggy! Good old Toby! Smell it, Toby, smell it!\u201d He\r\npushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog\u2019s nose, while the\r\ncreature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most comical\r\ncock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the _bouquet_ of a famous\r\nvintage. Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened a\r\nstout cord to the mongrel\u2019s collar, and led him to the foot of the\r\nwater-barrel. The creature instantly broke into a succession of high,\r\ntremulous yelps, and, with his nose on the ground, and his tail in the\r\nair, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and\r\nkept us at the top of our speed.\r\n\r\nThe east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see some\r\ndistance in the cold grey light. The square, massive house, with its\r\nblack, empty windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad and forlorn,\r\nbehind us. Our course led right across the grounds, in and out among\r\nthe trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected. The\r\nwhole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs, had a\r\nblighted, ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy which\r\nhung over it.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly,\r\nunderneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by a\r\nyoung beech. Where the two walls joined, several bricks had been\r\nloosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the\r\nlower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder. Holmes\r\nclambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he dropped it over upon the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s the print of wooden-leg\u2019s hand,\u201d he remarked, as I mounted up\r\nbeside him. \u201cYou see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster.\r\nWhat a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain since\r\nyesterday! The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their\r\neight-and-twenty hours\u2019 start.\u201d\r\n\r\nI confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great\r\ntraffic which had passed along the London road in the interval. My\r\nfears were soon appeased, however. Toby never hesitated or swerved, but\r\nwaddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion. Clearly, the pungent smell\r\nof the creasote rose high above all other contending scents.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not imagine,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat I depend for my success in this\r\ncase upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot\r\nin the chemical. I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace\r\nthem in many different ways. This, however, is the readiest and, since\r\nfortune has put it into our hands, I should be culpable if I neglected\r\nit. It has, however, prevented the case from becoming the pretty little\r\nintellectual problem which it at one time promised to be. There might\r\nhave been some credit to be gained out of it, but for this too palpable\r\nclue.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is credit, and to spare,\u201d said I. \u201cI assure you, Holmes, that I\r\nmarvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, even\r\nmore than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The thing seems to me to\r\nbe deeper and more inexplicable. How, for example, could you describe\r\nwith such confidence the wooden-legged man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPshaw, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself. I don\u2019t wish to be\r\ntheatrical. It is all patent and above-board. Two officers who are in\r\ncommand of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried\r\ntreasure. A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan\r\nSmall. You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain\r\nMorstan\u2019s possession. He had signed it in behalf of himself and his\r\nassociates,\u2014the sign of the four, as he somewhat dramatically called\r\nit. Aided by this chart, the officers\u2014or one of them\u2014gets the treasure\r\nand brings it to England, leaving, we will suppose, some condition\r\nunder which he received it unfulfilled. Now, then, why did not Jonathan\r\nSmall get the treasure himself? The answer is obvious. The chart is\r\ndated at a time when Morstan was brought into close association with\r\nconvicts. Jonathan Small did not get the treasure because he and his\r\nassociates were themselves convicts and could not get away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut that is mere speculation,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is more than that. It is the only hypothesis which covers the\r\nfacts. Let us see how it fits in with the sequel. Major Sholto remains\r\nat peace for some years, happy in the possession of his treasure. Then\r\nhe receives a letter from India which gives him a great fright. What\r\nwas that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr had escaped. That is much more likely, for he would have known what\r\ntheir term of imprisonment was. It would not have been a surprise to\r\nhim. What does he do then? He guards himself against a wooden-legged\r\nman,\u2014a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a white tradesman for him,\r\nand actually fires a pistol at him. Now, only one white man\u2019s name is\r\non the chart. The others are Hindoos or Mohammedans. There is no other\r\nwhite man. Therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden-legged\r\nman is identical with Jonathan Small. Does the reasoning strike you as\r\nbeing faulty?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo: it is clear and concise.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. Let us\r\nlook at it from his point of view. He comes to England with the double\r\nidea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having\r\nhis revenge upon the man who had wronged him. He found out where Sholto\r\nlived, and very possibly he established communications with some one\r\ninside the house. There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen.\r\nMrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could not\r\nfind out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever knew,\r\nsave the major and one faithful servant who had died. Suddenly Small\r\nlearns that the major is on his death-bed. In a frenzy lest the secret\r\nof the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes\r\nhis way to the dying man\u2019s window, and is only deterred from entering\r\nby the presence of his two sons. Mad with hate, however, against the\r\ndead man, he enters the room that night, searches his private papers in\r\nthe hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure, and\r\nfinally leaves a momento of his visit in the short inscription upon the\r\ncard. He had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major\r\nhe would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not\r\na common murder, but, from the point of view of the four associates,\r\nsomething in the nature of an act of justice. Whimsical and bizarre\r\nconceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime, and\r\nusually afford valuable indications as to the criminal. Do you follow\r\nall this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery clearly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, what could Jonathan Small do? He could only continue to keep a\r\nsecret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure. Possibly he\r\nleaves England and only comes back at intervals. Then comes the\r\ndiscovery of the garret, and he is instantly informed of it. We again\r\ntrace the presence of some confederate in the household. Jonathan, with\r\nhis wooden leg, is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of\r\nBartholomew Sholto. He takes with him, however, a rather curious\r\nassociate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his naked foot into\r\ncreasote, whence comes Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer\r\nwith a damaged tendo Achillis.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it was the associate, and not Jonathan, who committed the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. And rather to Jonathan\u2019s disgust, to judge by the way he\r\nstamped about when he got into the room. He bore no grudge against\r\nBartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if he could have been\r\nsimply bound and gagged. He did not wish to put his head in a halter.\r\nThere was no help for it, however: the savage instincts of his\r\ncompanion had broken out, and the poison had done its work: so Jonathan\r\nSmall left his record, lowered the treasure-box to the ground, and\r\nfollowed it himself. That was the train of events as far as I can\r\ndecipher them. Of course as to his personal appearance he must be\r\nmiddle-aged, and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an\r\noven as the Andamans. His height is readily calculated from the length\r\nof his stride, and we know that he was bearded. His hairiness was the\r\none point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him\r\nat the window. I don\u2019t know that there is anything else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe associate?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, well, there is no great mystery in that. But you will know all\r\nabout it soon enough. How sweet the morning air is! See how that one\r\nlittle cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo.\r\nNow the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank. It\r\nshines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on a\r\nstranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our petty\r\nambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces\r\nof nature! Are you well up in your Jean Paul?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFairly so. I worked back to him through Carlyle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was like following the brook to the parent lake. He makes one\r\ncurious but profound remark. It is that the chief proof of man\u2019s real\r\ngreatness lies in his perception of his own smallness. It argues, you\r\nsee, a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a\r\nproof of nobility. There is much food for thought in Richter. You have\r\nnot a pistol, have you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have my stick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get\r\nto their lair. Jonathan I shall leave to you, but if the other turns\r\nnasty I shall shoot him dead.\u201d He took out his revolver as he spoke,\r\nand, having loaded two of the chambers, he put it back into the\r\nright-hand pocket of his jacket.\r\n\r\nWe had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down the\r\nhalf-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis. Now,\r\nhowever, we were beginning to come among continuous streets, where\r\nlabourers and dockmen were already astir, and slatternly women were\r\ntaking down shutters and brushing door-steps. At the square-topped\r\ncorner public houses business was just beginning, and rough-looking men\r\nwere emerging, rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their\r\nmorning wet. Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as\r\nwe passed, but our inimitable Toby looked neither to the right nor to\r\nthe left, but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an\r\noccasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent.\r\n\r\nWe had traversed Streatham, Brixton, Camberwell, and now found\r\nourselves in Kennington Lane, having borne away through the\r\nside-streets to the east of the Oval. The men whom we pursued seemed to\r\nhave taken a curiously zigzag road, with the idea probably of escaping\r\nobservation. They had never kept to the main road if a parallel\r\nside-street would serve their turn. At the foot of Kennington Lane they\r\nhad edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles Street. Where\r\nthe latter street turns into Knight\u2019s Place, Toby ceased to advance,\r\nbut began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked and the\r\nother drooping, the very picture of canine indecision. Then he waddled\r\nround in circles, looking up to us from time to time, as if to ask for\r\nsympathy in his embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the deuce is the matter with the dog?\u201d growled Holmes. \u201cThey\r\nsurely would not take a cab, or go off in a balloon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps they stood here for some time,\u201d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! it\u2019s all right. He\u2019s off again,\u201d said my companion, in a tone of\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nHe was indeed off, for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up\r\nhis mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as he\r\nhad not yet shown. The scent appeared to be much hotter than before,\r\nfor he had not even to put his nose on the ground, but tugged at his\r\nleash and tried to break into a run. I could see by the gleam in\r\nHolmes\u2019s eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey.\r\n\r\nOur course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick and\r\nNelson\u2019s large timber-yard, just past the White Eagle tavern. Here the\r\ndog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the side-gate into\r\nthe enclosure, where the sawyers were already at work. On the dog raced\r\nthrough sawdust and shavings, down an alley, round a passage, between\r\ntwo wood-piles, and finally, with a triumphant yelp, sprang upon a\r\nlarge barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it had\r\nbeen brought. With lolling tongue and blinking eyes, Toby stood upon\r\nthe cask, looking from one to the other of us for some sign of\r\nappreciation. The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley\r\nwere smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air was heavy with the\r\nsmell of creasote.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other, and then burst\r\nsimultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\nThe Baker Street Irregulars\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d I asked. \u201cToby has lost his character for infallibility.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe acted according to his lights,\u201d said Holmes, lifting him down from\r\nthe barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard. \u201cIf you consider how\r\nmuch creasote is carted about London in one day, it is no great wonder\r\nthat our trail should have been crossed. It is much used now,\r\nespecially for the seasoning of wood. Poor Toby is not to blame.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must get on the main scent again, I suppose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. And, fortunately, we have no distance to go. Evidently what\r\npuzzled the dog at the corner of Knight\u2019s Place was that there were two\r\ndifferent trails running in opposite directions. We took the wrong one.\r\nIt only remains to follow the other.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no difficulty about this. On leading Toby to the place where\r\nhe had committed his fault, he cast about in a wide circle and finally\r\ndashed off in a fresh direction.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the\r\ncreasote-barrel came from,\u201d I observed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had thought of that. But you notice that he keeps on the pavement,\r\nwhereas the barrel passed down the roadway. No, we are on the true\r\nscent now.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt tended down towards the river-side, running through Belmont Place\r\nand Prince\u2019s Street. At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to\r\nthe water\u2019s edge, where there was a small wooden wharf. Toby led us to\r\nthe very edge of this, and there stood whining, looking out on the dark\r\ncurrent beyond.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are out of luck,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThey have taken to a boat here.\u201d\r\nSeveral small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the\r\nedge of the wharf. We took Toby round to each in turn, but, though he\r\nsniffed earnestly, he made no sign.\r\n\r\nClose to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a wooden\r\nplacard slung out through the second window. \u201cMordecai Smith\u201d was\r\nprinted across it in large letters, and, underneath, \u201cBoats to hire by\r\nthe hour or day.\u201d A second inscription above the door informed us that\r\na steam launch was kept,\u2014a statement which was confirmed by a great\r\npile of coke upon the jetty. Sherlock Holmes looked slowly round, and\r\nhis face assumed an ominous expression.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis looks bad,\u201d said he. \u201cThese fellows are sharper than I expected.\r\nThey seem to have covered their tracks. There has, I fear, been\r\npreconcerted management here.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and a little,\r\ncurly-headed lad of six came running out, followed by a stoutish,\r\nred-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou come back and be washed, Jack,\u201d she shouted. \u201cCome back, you young\r\nimp; for if your father comes home and finds you like that, he\u2019ll let\r\nus hear of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear little chap!\u201d said Holmes, strategically. \u201cWhat a rosy-cheeked\r\nyoung rascal! Now, Jack, is there anything you would like?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe youth pondered for a moment. \u201cI\u2019d like a shillin\u2019,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing you would like better?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like two shillin\u2019 better,\u201d the prodigy answered, after some\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere you are, then! Catch!\u2014A fine child, Mrs. Smith!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLor\u2019 bless you, sir, he is that, and forward. He gets a\u2019most too much\r\nfor me to manage, \u2019specially when my man is away days at a time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAway, is he?\u201d said Holmes, in a disappointed voice. \u201cI am sorry for\r\nthat, for I wanted to speak to Mr. Smith.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s been away since yesterday mornin\u2019, sir, and, truth to tell, I am\r\nbeginnin\u2019 to feel frightened about him. But if it was about a boat,\r\nsir, maybe I could serve as well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wanted to hire his steam launch.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, bless you, sir, it is in the steam launch that he has gone.\r\nThat\u2019s what puzzles me; for I know there ain\u2019t more coals in her than\r\nwould take her to about Woolwich and back. If he\u2019d been away in the\r\nbarge I\u2019d ha\u2019 thought nothin\u2019; for many a time a job has taken him as\r\nfar as Gravesend, and then if there was much doin\u2019 there he might ha\u2019\r\nstayed over. But what good is a steam launch without coals?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe might have bought some at a wharf down the river.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe might, sir, but it weren\u2019t his way. Many a time I\u2019ve heard him call\r\nout at the prices they charge for a few odd bags. Besides, I don\u2019t like\r\nthat wooden-legged man, wi\u2019 his ugly face and outlandish talk. What did\r\nhe want always knockin\u2019 about here for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA wooden-legged man?\u201d said Holmes, with bland surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, a brown, monkey-faced chap that\u2019s called more\u2019n once for my\r\nold man. It was him that roused him up yesternight, and, what\u2019s more,\r\nmy man knew he was comin\u2019, for he had steam up in the launch. I tell\r\nyou straight, sir, I don\u2019t feel easy in my mind about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, my dear Mrs. Smith,\u201d said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders, \u201cYou\r\nare frightening yourself about nothing. How could you possibly tell\r\nthat it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night? I don\u2019t quite\r\nunderstand how you can be so sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis voice, sir. I knew his voice, which is kind o\u2019 thick and foggy. He\r\ntapped at the winder,\u2014about three it would be. \u2018Show a leg, matey,\u2019\r\nsays he: \u2018time to turn out guard.\u2019 My old man woke up Jim,\u2014that\u2019s my\r\neldest,\u2014and away they went, without so much as a word to me. I could\r\nhear the wooden leg clackin\u2019 on the stones.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd was this wooden-legged man alone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t say, I am sure, sir. I didn\u2019t hear no one else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sorry, Mrs. Smith, for I wanted a steam launch, and I have heard\r\ngood reports of the\u2014Let me see, what is her name?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe _Aurora_, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! She\u2019s not that old green launch with a yellow line, very broad in\r\nthe beam?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed. She\u2019s as trim a little thing as any on the river. She\u2019s\r\nbeen fresh painted, black with two red streaks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThanks. I hope that you will hear soon from Mr. Smith. I am going down\r\nthe river; and if I should see anything of the _Aurora_ I shall let him\r\nknow that you are uneasy. A black funnel, you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir. Black with a white band.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, of course. It was the sides which were black. Good-morning, Mrs.\r\nSmith.\u2014There is a boatman here with a wherry, Watson. We shall take it\r\nand cross the river.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe main thing with people of that sort,\u201d said Holmes, as we sat in\r\nthe sheets of the wherry, \u201cis never to let them think that their\r\ninformation can be of the slightest importance to you. If you do, they\r\nwill instantly shut up like an oyster. If you listen to them under\r\nprotest, as it were, you are very likely to get what you want.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOur course now seems pretty clear,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat would you do, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the\r\n_Aurora_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, it would be a colossal task. She may have touched at\r\nany wharf on either side of the stream between here and Greenwich.\r\nBelow the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-places for\r\nmiles. It would take you days and days to exhaust them, if you set\r\nabout it alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEmploy the police, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. I shall probably call Athelney Jones in at the last moment. He is\r\nnot a bad fellow, and I should not like to do anything which would\r\ninjure him professionally. But I have a fancy for working it out\r\nmyself, now that we have gone so far.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCould we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWorse and worse! Our men would know that the chase was hot at their\r\nheels, and they would be off out of the country. As it is, they are\r\nlikely enough to leave, but as long as they think they are perfectly\r\nsafe they will be in no hurry. Jones\u2019s energy will be of use to us\r\nthere, for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily\r\npress, and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong\r\nscent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are we to do, then?\u201d I asked, as we landed near Millbank\r\nPenitentiary.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake this hansom, drive home, have some breakfast, and get an hour\u2019s\r\nsleep. It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again.\r\nStop at a telegraph-office, cabby! We will keep Toby, for he may be of\r\nuse to us yet.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe pulled up at the Great Peter Street post-office, and Holmes\r\ndespatched his wire. \u201cWhom do you think that is to?\u201d he asked, as we\r\nresumed our journey.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure I don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou remember the Baker Street division of the detective police force\r\nwhom I employed in the Jefferson Hope case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said I, laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is just the case where they might be invaluable. If they fail, I\r\nhave other resources; but I shall try them first. That wire was to my\r\ndirty little lieutenant, Wiggins, and I expect that he and his gang\r\nwill be with us before we have finished our breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was between eight and nine o\u2019clock now, and I was conscious of a\r\nstrong reaction after the successive excitements of the night. I was\r\nlimp and weary, befogged in mind and fatigued in body. I had not the\r\nprofessional enthusiasm which carried my companion on, nor could I look\r\nat the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem. As far as the\r\ndeath of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him, and\r\ncould feel no intense antipathy to his murderers. The treasure,\r\nhowever, was a different matter. That, or part of it, belonged\r\nrightfully to Miss Morstan. While there was a chance of recovering it I\r\nwas ready to devote my life to the one object. True, if I found it it\r\nwould probably put her forever beyond my reach. Yet it would be a petty\r\nand selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that.\r\nIf Holmes could work to find the criminals, I had a tenfold stronger\r\nreason to urge me on to find the treasure.\r\n\r\nA bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up\r\nwonderfully. When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid\r\nand Holmes pouring out the coffee.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere it is,\u201d said he, laughing, and pointing to an open newspaper.\r\n\u201cThe energetic Jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up\r\nbetween them. But you have had enough of the case. Better have your ham\r\nand eggs first.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took the paper from him and read the short notice, which was headed\r\n\u201cMysterious Business at Upper Norwood.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout twelve o\u2019clock last night,\u201d said the _Standard_, \u201cMr.\r\nBartholomew Sholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found dead\r\nin his room under circumstances which point to foul play. As far as we\r\ncan learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto\u2019s\r\nperson, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased\r\ngentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off. The\r\ndiscovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had\r\ncalled at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased.\r\nBy a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known\r\nmember of the detective police force, happened to be at the Norwood\r\nPolice Station, and was on the ground within half an hour of the first\r\nalarm. His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed\r\ntowards the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that\r\nthe brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with\r\nthe housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a\r\nporter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo. It is quite certain that the\r\nthief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones\u2019s\r\nwell-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation\r\nhave enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not\r\nhave entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their way\r\nacross the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room\r\nwhich communicated with that in which the body was found. This fact,\r\nwhich has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was\r\nno mere haphazard burglary. The prompt and energetic action of the\r\nofficers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such\r\noccasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind. We cannot but think\r\nthat it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our\r\ndetectives more decentralised, and so brought into closer and more\r\neffective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it gorgeous!\u201d said Holmes, grinning over his coffee-cup. \u201cWhat\r\ndo you think of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for\r\nthe crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo do I. I wouldn\u2019t answer for our safety now, if he should happen to\r\nhave another of his attacks of energy.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a loud ring at the bell, and I could hear Mrs.\r\nHudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy heaven, Holmes,\u201d I said, half rising, \u201cI believe that they are\r\nreally after us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not quite so bad as that. It is the unofficial force,\u2014the\r\nBaker Street irregulars.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon the\r\nstairs, a clatter of high voices, and in rushed a dozen dirty and\r\nragged little street-Arabs. There was some show of discipline among\r\nthem, despite their tumultuous entry, for they instantly drew up in\r\nline and stood facing us with expectant faces. One of their number,\r\ntaller and older than the others, stood forward with an air of lounging\r\nsuperiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little\r\nscarecrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cGot your message, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cand brought \u2019em on sharp. Three bob\r\nand a tanner for tickets.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere you are,\u201d said Holmes, producing some silver. \u201cIn future they can\r\nreport to you, Wiggins, and you to me. I cannot have the house invaded\r\nin this way. However, it is just as well that you should all hear the\r\ninstructions. I want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch called\r\nthe _Aurora_, owner Mordecai Smith, black with two red streaks, funnel\r\nblack with a white band. She is down the river somewhere. I want one\r\nboy to be at Mordecai Smith\u2019s landing-stage opposite Millbank to say if\r\nthe boat comes back. You must divide it out among yourselves, and do\r\nboth banks thoroughly. Let me know the moment you have news. Is that\r\nall clear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, guv\u2019nor,\u201d said Wiggins.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat.\r\nHere\u2019s a day in advance. Now off you go!\u201d He handed them a shilling\r\neach, and away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them a moment\r\nlater streaming down the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf the launch is above water they will find her,\u201d said Holmes, as he\r\nrose from the table and lit his pipe. \u201cThey can go everywhere, see\r\neverything, overhear every one. I expect to hear before evening that\r\nthey have spotted her. In the meanwhile, we can do nothing but await\r\nresults. We cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either the\r\n_Aurora_ or Mr. Mordecai Smith.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cToby could eat these scraps, I dare say. Are you going to bed,\r\nHolmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; I am not tired. I have a curious constitution. I never remember\r\nfeeling tired by work, though idleness exhausts me completely. I am\r\ngoing to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair\r\nclient has introduced us. If ever man had an easy task, this of ours\r\nought to be. Wooden-legged men are not so common, but the other man\r\nmust, I should think, be absolutely unique.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat other man again!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no wish to make a mystery of him,\u2014to you, anyway. But you must\r\nhave formed your own opinion. Now, do consider the data. Diminutive\r\nfootmarks, toes never fettered by boots, naked feet, stone-headed\r\nwooden mace, great agility, small poisoned darts. What do you make of\r\nall this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA savage!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cPerhaps one of those Indians who were the\r\nassociates of Jonathan Small.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHardly that,\u201d said he. \u201cWhen first I saw signs of strange weapons I\r\nwas inclined to think so; but the remarkable character of the footmarks\r\ncaused me to reconsider my views. Some of the inhabitants of the Indian\r\nPeninsula are small men, but none could have left such marks as that.\r\nThe Hindoo proper has long and thin feet. The sandal-wearing Mohammedan\r\nhas the great toe well separated from the others, because the thong is\r\ncommonly passed between. These little darts, too, could only be shot in\r\none way. They are from a blow-pipe. Now, then, where are we to find our\r\nsavage?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSouth American,\u201d I hazarded.\r\n\r\nHe stretched his hand up, and took down a bulky volume from the shelf.\r\n\u201cThis is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published.\r\nIt may be looked upon as the very latest authority. What have we here?\r\n\u2018Andaman Islands, situated 340 miles to the north of Sumatra, in the\r\nBay of Bengal.\u2019 Hum! hum! What\u2019s all this? Moist climate, coral reefs,\r\nsharks, Port Blair, convict-barracks, Rutland Island, cottonwoods\u2014Ah,\r\nhere we are. \u2018The aborigines of the Andaman Islands may perhaps claim\r\nthe distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth, though some\r\nanthropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa, the Digger Indians of\r\nAmerica, and the Terra del Fuegians. The average height is rather below\r\nfour feet, although many full-grown adults may be found who are very\r\nmuch smaller than this. They are a fierce, morose, and intractable\r\npeople, though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their\r\nconfidence has once been gained.\u2019 Mark that, Watson. Now, then, listen\r\nto this. \u2018They are naturally hideous, having large, misshapen heads,\r\nsmall, fierce eyes, and distorted features. Their feet and hands,\r\nhowever, are remarkably small. So intractable and fierce are they that\r\nall the efforts of the British official have failed to win them over in\r\nany degree. They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews,\r\nbraining the survivors with their stone-headed clubs, or shooting them\r\nwith their poisoned arrows. These massacres are invariably concluded by\r\na cannibal feast.\u2019 Nice, amiable people, Watson! If this fellow had\r\nbeen left to his own unaided devices this affair might have taken an\r\neven more ghastly turn. I fancy that, even as it is, Jonathan Small\r\nwould give a good deal not to have employed him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how came he to have so singular a companion?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that is more than I can tell. Since, however, we had already\r\ndetermined that Small had come from the Andamans, it is not so very\r\nwonderful that this islander should be with him. No doubt we shall know\r\nall about it in time. Look here, Watson; you look regularly done. Lie\r\ndown there on the sofa, and see if I can put you to sleep.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took up his violin from the corner, and as I stretched myself out he\r\nbegan to play some low, dreamy, melodious air,\u2014his own, no doubt, for\r\nhe had a remarkable gift for improvisation. I have a vague remembrance\r\nof his gaunt limbs, his earnest face, and the rise and fall of his bow.\r\nThen I seemed to be floated peacefully away upon a soft sea of sound,\r\nuntil I found myself in dreamland, with the sweet face of Mary Morstan\r\nlooking down upon me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\nA Break in the Chain\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon before I woke, strengthened and refreshed.\r\nSherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him, save that he had\r\nlaid aside his violin and was deep in a book. He looked across at me,\r\nas I stirred, and I noticed that his face was dark and troubled.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have slept soundly,\u201d he said. \u201cI feared that our talk would wake\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI heard nothing,\u201d I answered. \u201cHave you had fresh news, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, no. I confess that I am surprised and disappointed. I\r\nexpected something definite by this time. Wiggins has just been up to\r\nreport. He says that no trace can be found of the launch. It is a\r\nprovoking check, for every hour is of importance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan I do anything? I am perfectly fresh now, and quite ready for\r\nanother night\u2019s outing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, we can do nothing. We can only wait. If we go ourselves, the\r\nmessage might come in our absence, and delay be caused. You can do what\r\nyou will, but I must remain on guard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. Cecil\r\nForrester. She asked me to, yesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn Mrs. Cecil Forrester?\u201d asked Holmes, with the twinkle of a smile in\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, of course Miss Morstan too. They were anxious to hear what\r\nhappened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would not tell them too much,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWomen are never to be\r\nentirely trusted,\u2014not the best of them.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment. \u201cI shall be\r\nback in an hour or two,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right! Good luck! But, I say, if you are crossing the river you\r\nmay as well return Toby, for I don\u2019t think it is at all likely that we\r\nshall have any use for him now.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took our mongrel accordingly, and left him, together with a\r\nhalf-sovereign, at the old naturalist\u2019s in Pinchin Lane. At Camberwell\r\nI found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night\u2019s adventures, but\r\nvery eager to hear the news. Mrs. Forrester, too, was full of\r\ncuriosity. I told them all that we had done, suppressing, however, the\r\nmore dreadful parts of the tragedy. Thus, although I spoke of Mr.\r\nSholto\u2019s death, I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it.\r\nWith all my omissions, however, there was enough to startle and amaze\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a romance!\u201d cried Mrs. Forrester. \u201cAn injured lady, half a\r\nmillion in treasure, a black cannibal, and a wooden-legged ruffian.\r\nThey take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd two knight-errants to the rescue,\u201d added Miss Morstan, with a\r\nbright glance at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Mary, your fortune depends upon the issue of this search. I don\u2019t\r\nthink that you are nearly excited enough. Just imagine what it must be\r\nto be so rich, and to have the world at your feet!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt sent a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she showed no\r\nsign of elation at the prospect. On the contrary, she gave a toss of\r\nher proud head, as though the matter were one in which she took small\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing\r\nelse is of any consequence; but I think that he has behaved most kindly\r\nand honourably throughout. It is our duty to clear him of this dreadful\r\nand unfounded charge.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was evening before I left Camberwell, and quite dark by the time I\r\nreached home. My companion\u2019s book and pipe lay by his chair, but he had\r\ndisappeared. I looked about in the hope of seeing a note, but there was\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out,\u201d I said to Mrs.\r\nHudson as she came up to lower the blinds.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir. He has gone to his room, sir. Do you know, sir,\u201d sinking her\r\nvoice into an impressive whisper, \u201cI am afraid for his health?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy so, Mrs. Hudson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s that strange, sir. After you was gone he walked and he\r\nwalked, up and down, and up and down, until I was weary of the sound of\r\nhis footstep. Then I heard him talking to himself and muttering, and\r\nevery time the bell rang out he came on the stairhead, with \u2018What is\r\nthat, Mrs. Hudson?\u2019 And now he has slammed off to his room, but I can\r\nhear him walking away the same as ever. I hope he\u2019s not going to be\r\nill, sir. I ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine,\r\nbut he turned on me, sir, with such a look that I don\u2019t know how ever I\r\ngot out of the room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that you have any cause to be uneasy, Mrs. Hudson,\u201d I\r\nanswered. \u201cI have seen him like this before. He has some small matter\r\nupon his mind which makes him restless.\u201d I tried to speak lightly to\r\nour worthy landlady, but I was myself somewhat uneasy when through the\r\nlong night I still from time to time heard the dull sound of his tread,\r\nand knew how his keen spirit was chafing against this involuntary\r\ninaction.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast-time he looked worn and haggard, with a little fleck of\r\nfeverish colour upon either cheek.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are knocking yourself up, old man,\u201d I remarked. \u201cI heard you\r\nmarching about in the night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I could not sleep,\u201d he answered. \u201cThis infernal problem is\r\nconsuming me. It is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle, when\r\nall else had been overcome. I know the men, the launch, everything; and\r\nyet I can get no news. I have set other agencies at work, and used\r\nevery means at my disposal. The whole river has been searched on either\r\nside, but there is no news, nor has Mrs. Smith heard of her husband. I\r\nshall come to the conclusion soon that they have scuttled the craft.\r\nBut there are objections to that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr that Mrs. Smith has put us on a wrong scent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I think that may be dismissed. I had inquiries made, and there is\r\na launch of that description.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCould it have gone up the river?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have considered that possibility too, and there is a search-party\r\nwho will work up as far as Richmond. If no news comes to-day, I shall\r\nstart off myself to-morrow, and go for the men rather than the boat.\r\nBut surely, surely, we shall hear something.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe did not, however. Not a word came to us either from Wiggins or from\r\nthe other agencies. There were articles in most of the papers upon the\r\nNorwood tragedy. They all appeared to be rather hostile to the\r\nunfortunate Thaddeus Sholto. No fresh details were to be found,\r\nhowever, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon the\r\nfollowing day. I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report our\r\nill success to the ladies, and on my return I found Holmes dejected and\r\nsomewhat morose. He would hardly reply to my questions, and busied\r\nhimself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved\r\nmuch heating of retorts and distilling of vapours, ending at last in a\r\nsmell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. Up to the small hours\r\nof the morning I could hear the clinking of his test-tubes which told\r\nme that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment.\r\n\r\nIn the early dawn I woke with a start, and was surprised to find him\r\nstanding by my bedside, clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket,\r\nand a coarse red scarf round his neck.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am off down the river, Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cI have been turning it\r\nover in my mind, and I can see only one way out of it. It is worth\r\ntrying, at all events.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely I can come with you, then?\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my\r\nrepresentative. I am loath to go, for it is quite on the cards that\r\nsome message may come during the day, though Wiggins was despondent\r\nabout it last night. I want you to open all notes and telegrams, and to\r\nact on your own judgment if any news should come. Can I rely upon you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMost certainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me, for I can hardly\r\ntell yet where I may find myself. If I am in luck, however, I may not\r\nbe gone so very long. I shall have news of some sort or other before I\r\nget back.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time. On opening the\r\n_Standard_, however, I found that there was a fresh allusion to the\r\nbusiness. \u201cWith reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy,\u201d it remarked,\r\n\u201cwe have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more\r\ncomplex and mysterious than was originally supposed. Fresh evidence has\r\nshown that it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have\r\nbeen in any way concerned in the matter. He and the housekeeper, Mrs.\r\nBernstone, were both released yesterday evening. It is believed,\r\nhowever, that the police have a clue as to the real culprits, and that\r\nit is being prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard, with\r\nall his well-known energy and sagacity. Further arrests may be expected\r\nat any moment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is satisfactory so far as it goes,\u201d thought I. \u201cFriend Sholto is\r\nsafe, at any rate. I wonder what the fresh clue may be; though it seems\r\nto be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder.\u201d\r\n\r\nI tossed the paper down upon the table, but at that moment my eye\r\ncaught an advertisement in the agony column. It ran in this way:\r\n\r\n\u201cLost.\u2014Whereas Mordecai Smith, boatman, and his son, Jim, left Smith\u2019s\r\nWharf at or about three o\u2019clock last Tuesday morning in the steam\r\nlaunch _Aurora_, black with two red stripes, funnel black with a white\r\nband, the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give\r\ninformation to Mrs. Smith, at Smith\u2019s Wharf, or at 221_b_ Baker Street,\r\nas to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch\r\n_Aurora_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was clearly Holmes\u2019s doing. The Baker Street address was enough to\r\nprove that. It struck me as rather ingenious, because it might be read\r\nby the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural\r\nanxiety of a wife for her missing husband.\r\n\r\nIt was a long day. Every time that a knock came to the door, or a sharp\r\nstep passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmes\r\nreturning or an answer to his advertisement. I tried to read, but my\r\nthoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted\r\nand villainous pair whom we were pursuing. Could there be, I wondered,\r\nsome radical flaw in my companion\u2019s reasoning. Might he be suffering\r\nfrom some huge self-deception? Was it not possible that his nimble and\r\nspeculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises? I\r\nhad never known him to be wrong; and yet the keenest reasoner may\r\noccasionally be deceived. He was likely, I thought, to fall into error\r\nthrough the over-refinement of his logic,\u2014his preference for a subtle\r\nand bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay\r\nready to his hand. Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen the\r\nevidence, and I had heard the reasons for his deductions. When I looked\r\nback on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them trivial\r\nin themselves, but all tending in the same direction, I could not\r\ndisguise from myself that even if Holmes\u2019s explanation were incorrect\r\nthe true theory must be equally _outr\u00e9_ and startling.\r\n\r\nAt three o\u2019clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell, an\r\nauthoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person\r\nthan Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was he,\r\nhowever, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who\r\nhad taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. His expression\r\nwas downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-day, sir; good-day,\u201d said he. \u201cMr. Sherlock Holmes is out, I\r\nunderstand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and I cannot be sure when he will be back. But perhaps you would\r\ncare to wait. Take that chair and try one of these cigars.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you; I don\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d said he, mopping his face with a red\r\nbandanna handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd a whiskey-and-soda?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, half a glass. It is very hot for the time of year; and I have\r\nhad a good deal to worry and try me. You know my theory about this\r\nNorwood case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI remember that you expressed one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have been obliged to reconsider it. I had my net drawn tightly\r\nround Mr. Sholto, sir, when pop he went through a hole in the middle of\r\nit. He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken. From the\r\ntime that he left his brother\u2019s room he was never out of sight of some\r\none or other. So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and through\r\ntrap-doors. It\u2019s a very dark case, and my professional credit is at\r\nstake. I should be very glad of a little assistance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe all need help sometimes,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man, sir,\u201d said he, in\r\na husky and confidential voice. \u201cHe\u2019s a man who is not to be beat. I\r\nhave known that young man go into a good many cases, but I never saw\r\nthe case yet that he could not throw a light upon. He is irregular in\r\nhis methods, and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories, but, on\r\nthe whole, I think he would have made a most promising officer, and I\r\ndon\u2019t care who knows it. I have had a wire from him this morning, by\r\nwhich I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business.\r\nHere is the message.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took the telegram out of his pocket, and handed it to me. It was\r\ndated from Poplar at twelve o\u2019clock. \u201cGo to Baker Street at once,\u201d it\r\nsaid. \u201cIf I have not returned, wait for me. I am close on the track of\r\nthe Sholto gang. You can come with us to-night if you want to be in at\r\nthe finish.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis sounds well. He has evidently picked up the scent again,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, then he has been at fault too,\u201d exclaimed Jones, with evident\r\nsatisfaction. \u201cEven the best of us are thrown off sometimes. Of course\r\nthis may prove to be a false alarm; but it is my duty as an officer of\r\nthe law to allow no chance to slip. But there is some one at the door.\r\nPerhaps this is he.\u201d\r\n\r\nA heavy step was heard ascending the stair, with a great wheezing and\r\nrattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath. Once or\r\ntwice he stopped, as though the climb were too much for him, but at\r\nlast he made his way to our door and entered. His appearance\r\ncorresponded to the sounds which we had heard. He was an aged man, clad\r\nin seafaring garb, with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his throat.\r\nHis back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathing was\r\npainfully asthmatic. As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his\r\nshoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs. He had a\r\ncoloured scarf round his chin, and I could see little of his face save\r\na pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows, and long grey\r\nside-whiskers. Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable\r\nmaster mariner who had fallen into years and poverty.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, my man?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\nHe looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; but I am acting for him. You can tell me any message you have for\r\nhim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was to him himself I was to tell it,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I tell you that I am acting for him. Was it about Mordecai Smith\u2019s\r\nboat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I knows well where it is. An\u2019 I knows where the men he is after\r\nare. An\u2019 I knows where the treasure is. I knows all about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen tell me, and I shall let him know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was to him I was to tell it,\u201d he repeated, with the petulant\r\nobstinacy of a very old man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you must wait for him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no; I ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to lose a whole day to please no one. If Mr.\r\nHolmes ain\u2019t here, then Mr. Holmes must find it all out for himself. I\r\ndon\u2019t care about the look of either of you, and I won\u2019t tell a word.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe shuffled towards the door, but Athelney Jones got in front of him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a bit, my friend,\u201d said he. \u201cYou have important information, and\r\nyou must not walk off. We shall keep you, whether you like or not,\r\nuntil our friend returns.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old man made a little run towards the door, but, as Athelney Jones\r\nput his broad back up against it, he recognised the uselessness of\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n\u201cPretty sort o\u2019 treatment this!\u201d he cried, stamping his stick. \u201cI come\r\nhere to see a gentleman, and you two, who I never saw in my life, seize\r\nme and treat me in this fashion!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will be none the worse,\u201d I said. \u201cWe shall recompense you for the\r\nloss of your time. Sit over here on the sofa, and you will not have\r\nlong to wait.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe came across sullenly enough, and seated himself with his face\r\nresting on his hands. Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk.\r\nSuddenly, however, Holmes\u2019s voice broke in upon us.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that you might offer me a cigar too,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nWe both started in our chairs. There was Holmes sitting close to us\r\nwith an air of quiet amusement.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cYou here! But where is the old man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is the old man,\u201d said he, holding out a heap of white hair. \u201cHere\r\nhe is,\u2014wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all. I thought my disguise was\r\npretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that test.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, You rogue!\u201d cried Jones, highly delighted. \u201cYou would have made an\r\nactor, and a rare one. You had the proper workhouse cough, and those\r\nweak legs of yours are worth ten pounds a week. I thought I knew the\r\nglint of your eye, though. You didn\u2019t get away from us so easily, You\r\nsee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been working in that get-up all day,\u201d said he, lighting his\r\ncigar. \u201cYou see, a good many of the criminal classes begin to know\r\nme,\u2014especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my\r\ncases: so I can only go on the war-path under some simple disguise like\r\nthis. You got my wire?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; that was what brought me here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow has your case prospered?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has all come to nothing. I have had to release two of my prisoners,\r\nand there is no evidence against the other two.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind. We shall give you two others in the place of them. But you\r\nmust put yourself under my orders. You are welcome to all the official\r\ncredit, but you must act on the line that I point out. Is that agreed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEntirely, if you will help me to the men.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, in the first place I shall want a fast police-boat\u2014a steam\r\nlaunch\u2014to be at the Westminster Stairs at seven o\u2019clock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is easily managed. There is always one about there; but I can\r\nstep across the road and telephone to make sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall want two stanch men, in case of resistance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere will be two or three in the boat. What else?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen we secure the men we shall get the treasure. I think that it\r\nwould be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the\r\nyoung lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs. Let her be the first\r\nto open it.\u2014Eh, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would be a great pleasure to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRather an irregular proceeding,\u201d said Jones, shaking his head.\r\n\u201cHowever, the whole thing is irregular, and I suppose we must wink at\r\nit. The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities\r\nuntil after the official investigation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. That is easily managed. One other point. I should much like\r\nto have a few details about this matter from the lips of Jonathan Small\r\nhimself. You know I like to work the detail of my cases out. There is\r\nno objection to my having an unofficial interview with him, either here\r\nin my rooms or elsewhere, as long as he is efficiently guarded?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you are master of the situation. I have had no proof yet of the\r\nexistence of this Jonathan Small. However, if you can catch him I don\u2019t\r\nsee how I can refuse you an interview with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is understood, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerfectly. Is there anything else?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly that I insist upon your dining with us. It will be ready in half\r\nan hour. I have oysters and a brace of grouse, with something a little\r\nchoice in white wines.\u2014Watson, you have never yet recognised my merits\r\nas a housekeeper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\nThe End of the Islander\r\n\r\n\r\nOur meal was a merry one. Holmes could talk exceedingly well when he\r\nchose, and that night he did choose. He appeared to be in a state of\r\nnervous exaltation. I have never known him so brilliant. He spoke on a\r\nquick succession of subjects,\u2014on miracle-plays, on medi\u00e6val pottery, on\r\nStradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on the war-ships\r\nof the future,\u2014handling each as though he had made a special study of\r\nit. His bright humour marked the reaction from his black depression of\r\nthe preceding days. Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in his\r\nhours of relaxation, and faced his dinner with the air of a _bon\r\nvivant_. For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing\r\nthe end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes\u2019s gaiety. None of\r\nus alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together.\r\n\r\nWhen the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at his watch, and filled up\r\nthree glasses with port. \u201cOne bumper,\u201d said he, \u201cto the success of our\r\nlittle expedition. And now it is high time we were off. Have you a\r\npistol, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have my old service-revolver in my desk.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou had best take it, then. It is well to be prepared. I see that the\r\ncab is at the door. I ordered it for half-past six.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf, and\r\nfound our launch awaiting us. Holmes eyed it critically.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there anything to mark it as a police-boat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u2014that green lamp at the side.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen take it off.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were cast\r\noff. Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern. There was one man at the\r\nrudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d asked Jones.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the Tower. Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson\u2019s Yard.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur craft was evidently a very fast one. We shot past the long lines of\r\nloaded barges as though they were stationary. Holmes smiled with\r\nsatisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe ought to be able to catch anything on the river,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, hardly that. But there are not many launches to beat us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall have to catch the _Aurora_, and she has a name for being a\r\nclipper. I will tell you how the land lies, Watson. You recollect how\r\nannoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical\r\nanalysis. One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work\r\nis the best rest. So it is. When I had succeeded in dissolving the\r\nhydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to our problem of the\r\nSholtos, and thought the whole matter out again. My boys had been up\r\nthe river and down the river without result. The launch was not at any\r\nlanding-stage or wharf, nor had it returned. Yet it could hardly have\r\nbeen scuttled to hide their traces,\u2014though that always remained as a\r\npossible hypothesis if all else failed. I knew this man Small had a\r\ncertain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capable of\r\nanything in the nature of delicate finesse. That is usually a product\r\nof higher education. I then reflected that since he had certainly been\r\nin London some time\u2014as we had evidence that he maintained a continual\r\nwatch over Pondicherry Lodge\u2014he could hardly leave at a moment\u2019s\r\nnotice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, to\r\narrange his affairs. That was the balance of probability, at any rate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me to be a little weak,\u201d said I. \u201cIt is more probable that\r\nhe had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his\r\nexpedition.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I hardly think so. This lair of his would be too valuable a\r\nretreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he\r\ncould do without it. But a second consideration struck me. Jonathan\r\nSmall must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion,\r\nhowever much he may have top-coated him, would give rise to gossip, and\r\npossibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy. He was quite sharp\r\nenough to see that. They had started from their head-quarters under\r\ncover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broad\r\nlight. Now, it was past three o\u2019clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when\r\nthey got the boat. It would be quite bright, and people would be about\r\nin an hour or so. Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far. They\r\npaid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final\r\nescape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. In a\r\ncouple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took,\r\nand whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under\r\ncover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where no\r\ndoubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the\r\nColonies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the launch? They could not have taken that to their lodgings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spite\r\nof its invisibility. I then put myself in the place of Small, and\r\nlooked at it as a man of his capacity would. He would probably consider\r\nthat to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make\r\npursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track. How, then,\r\ncould he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted? I\r\nwondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes. I could only\r\nthink of one way of doing it. I might hand the launch over to some\r\nboat-builder or repairer, with directions to make a trifling change in\r\nher. She would then be removed to his shed or yard, and so be\r\neffectually concealed, while at the same time I could have her at a few\r\nhours\u2019 notice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat seems simple enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be\r\noverlooked. However, I determined to act on the idea. I started at once\r\nin this harmless seaman\u2019s rig and inquired at all the yards down the\r\nriver. I drew blank at fifteen, but at the sixteenth\u2014Jacobson\u2019s\u2014I\r\nlearned that the _Aurora_ had been handed over to them two days ago by\r\na wooden-legged man, with some trivial directions as to her rudder.\r\n\u2018There ain\u2019t naught amiss with her rudder,\u2019 said the foreman. \u2018There\r\nshe lies, with the red streaks.\u2019 At that moment who should come down\r\nbut Mordecai Smith, the missing owner? He was rather the worse for\r\nliquor. I should not, of course, have known him, but he bellowed out\r\nhis name and the name of his launch. \u2018I want her to-night at eight\r\no\u2019clock,\u2019 said he,\u2014\u2018eight o\u2019clock sharp, mind, for I have two gentlemen\r\nwho won\u2019t be kept waiting.\u2019 They had evidently paid him well, for he\r\nwas very flush of money, chucking shillings about to the men. I\r\nfollowed him some distance, but he subsided into an ale-house: so I\r\nwent back to the yard, and, happening to pick up one of my boys on the\r\nway, I stationed him as a sentry over the launch. He is to stand at\r\nwater\u2019s edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start. We shall\r\nbe lying off in the stream, and it will be a strange thing if we do not\r\ntake men, treasure, and all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right men or\r\nnot,\u201d said Jones; \u201cbut if the affair were in my hands I should have had\r\na body of police in Jacobson\u2019s Yard, and arrested them when they came\r\ndown.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich would have been never. This man Small is a pretty shrewd fellow.\r\nHe would send a scout on ahead, and if anything made him suspicious lie\r\nsnug for another week.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith, and so been led to their\r\nhiding-place,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that case I should have wasted my day. I think that it is a hundred\r\nto one against Smith knowing where they live. As long as he has liquor\r\nand good pay, why should he ask questions? They send him messages what\r\nto do. No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the best.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation had been proceeding, we had been shooting the\r\nlong series of bridges which span the Thames. As we passed the City the\r\nlast rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of St.\r\nPaul\u2019s. It was twilight before we reached the Tower.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is Jacobson\u2019s Yard,\u201d said Holmes, pointing to a bristle of masts\r\nand rigging on the Surrey side. \u201cCruise gently up and down here under\r\ncover of this string of lighters.\u201d He took a pair of night-glasses from\r\nhis pocket and gazed some time at the shore. \u201cI see my sentry at his\r\npost,\u201d he remarked, \u201cbut no sign of a handkerchief.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them,\u201d said\r\nJones, eagerly. We were all eager by this time, even the policemen and\r\nstokers, who had a very vague idea of what was going forward.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have no right to take anything for granted,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cIt\r\nis certainly ten to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot be\r\ncertain. From this point we can see the entrance of the yard, and they\r\ncan hardly see us. It will be a clear night and plenty of light. We\r\nmust stay where we are. See how the folk swarm over yonder in the\r\ngaslight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are coming from work in the yard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDirty-looking rascals, but I suppose every one has some little\r\nimmortal spark concealed about him. You would not think it, to look at\r\nthem. There is no _a priori_ probability about it. A strange enigma is\r\nman!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome one calls him a soul concealed in an animal,\u201d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\u201cWinwood Reade is good upon the subject,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHe remarks\r\nthat, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate\r\nhe becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for example, never\r\nforetell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what\r\nan average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages\r\nremain constant. So says the statistician. But do I see a handkerchief?\r\nSurely there is a white flutter over yonder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it is your boy,\u201d I cried. \u201cI can see him plainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd there is the _Aurora_,\u201d exclaimed Holmes, \u201cand going like the\r\ndevil! Full speed ahead, engineer. Make after that launch with the\r\nyellow light. By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves to\r\nhave the heels of us!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind two\r\nor three small craft, so that she had fairly got her speed up before we\r\nsaw her. Now she was flying down the stream, near in to the shore,\r\ngoing at a tremendous rate. Jones looked gravely at her and shook his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is very fast,\u201d he said. \u201cI doubt if we shall catch her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe _must_ catch her!\u201d cried Holmes, between his teeth. \u201cHeap it on,\r\nstokers! Make her do all she can! If we burn the boat we must have\r\nthem!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were fairly after her now. The furnaces roared, and the powerful\r\nengines whizzed and clanked, like a great metallic heart. Her sharp,\r\nsteep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves to\r\nright and to left of us. With every throb of the engines we sprang and\r\nquivered like a living thing. One great yellow lantern in our bows\r\nthrew a long, flickering funnel of light in front of us. Right ahead a\r\ndark blur upon the water showed where the _Aurora_ lay, and the swirl\r\nof white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going. We\r\nflashed past barges, steamers, merchant-vessels, in and out, behind\r\nthis one and round the other. Voices hailed us out of the darkness, but\r\nstill the _Aurora_ thundered on, and still we followed close upon her\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\n\u201cPile it on, men, pile it on!\u201d cried Holmes, looking down into the\r\nengine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager,\r\naquiline face. \u201cGet every pound of steam you can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we gain a little,\u201d said Jones, with his eyes on the _Aurora_.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure of it,\u201d said I. \u201cWe shall be up with her in a very few\r\nminutes.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with\r\nthree barges in tow blundered in between us. It was only by putting our\r\nhelm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could round\r\nthem and recover our way the _Aurora_ had gained a good two hundred\r\nyards. She was still, however, well in view, and the murky uncertain\r\ntwilight was setting into a clear starlit night. Our boilers were\r\nstrained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with\r\nthe fierce energy which was driving us along. We had shot through the\r\nPool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up\r\nagain after rounding the Isle of Dogs. The dull blur in front of us\r\nresolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty _Aurora_. Jones\r\nturned our search-light upon her, so that we could plainly see the\r\nfigures upon her deck. One man sat by the stern, with something black\r\nbetween his knees over which he stooped. Beside him lay a dark mass\r\nwhich looked like a Newfoundland dog. The boy held the tiller, while\r\nagainst the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith, stripped to\r\nthe waist, and shovelling coals for dear life. They may have had some\r\ndoubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now as\r\nwe followed every winding and turning which they took there could no\r\nlonger be any question about it. At Greenwich we were about three\r\nhundred paces behind them. At Blackwall we could not have been more\r\nthan two hundred and fifty. I have coursed many creatures in many\r\ncountries during my checkered career, but never did sport give me such\r\na wild thrill as this mad, flying man-hunt down the Thames. Steadily we\r\ndrew in upon them, yard by yard. In the silence of the night we could\r\nhear the panting and clanking of their machinery. The man in the stern\r\nstill crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though he\r\nwere busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure with a\r\nglance the distance which still separated us. Nearer we came and\r\nnearer. Jones yelled to them to stop. We were not more than four boat\u2019s\r\nlengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace. It was a\r\nclear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and the\r\nmelancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man in the\r\nstern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at us,\r\ncursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized,\r\npowerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I could\r\nsee that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the\r\nright side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries there was\r\nmovement in the huddled bundle upon the deck. It straightened itself\r\ninto a little black man\u2014the smallest I have ever seen\u2014with a great,\r\nmisshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair. Holmes had\r\nalready drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this\r\nsavage, distorted creature. He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster\r\nor blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that face was enough\r\nto give a man a sleepless night. Never have I seen features so deeply\r\nmarked with all bestiality and cruelty. His small eyes glowed and\r\nburned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from\r\nhis teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury.\r\n\r\n\u201cFire if he raises his hand,\u201d said Holmes, quietly. We were within a\r\nboat\u2019s-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. I\r\ncan see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his legs\r\nfar apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with his\r\nhideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light\r\nof our lantern.\r\n\r\nIt was well that we had so clear a view of him. Even as we looked he\r\nplucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood, like\r\na school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pistols rang out\r\ntogether. He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind of\r\nchoking cough fell sideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse of\r\nhis venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters. At the\r\nsame moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put\r\nit hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank,\r\nwhile we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet. We were\r\nround after her in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank.\r\nIt was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide\r\nexpanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water and beds of\r\ndecaying vegetation. The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the\r\nmud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water.\r\nThe fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole length\r\ninto the sodden soil. In vain he struggled and writhed. Not one step\r\ncould he possibly take either forwards or backwards. He yelled in\r\nimpotent rage, and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot,\r\nbut his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky\r\nbank. When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored\r\nthat it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that\r\nwe were able to haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish,\r\nover our side. The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in their\r\nlaunch, but came aboard meekly enough when commanded. The _Aurora_\r\nherself we hauled off and made fast to our stern. A solid iron chest of\r\nIndian workmanship stood upon the deck. This, there could be no\r\nquestion, was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of\r\nthe Sholtos. There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so we\r\ntransferred it carefully to our own little cabin. As we steamed slowly\r\nup-stream again, we flashed our search-light in every direction, but\r\nthere was no sign of the Islander. Somewhere in the dark ooze at the\r\nbottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our\r\nshores.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here,\u201d said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway. \u201cWe were\r\nhardly quick enough with our pistols.\u201d There, sure enough, just behind\r\nwhere we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we\r\nknew so well. It must have whizzed between us at the instant that we\r\nfired. Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy\r\nfashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible\r\ndeath which had passed so close to us that night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\nThe Great Agra Treasure\r\n\r\n\r\nOur captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done\r\nso much and waited so long to gain. He was a sunburned, reckless-eyed\r\nfellow, with a network of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany\r\nfeatures, which told of a hard, open-air life. There was a singular\r\nprominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be\r\neasily turned from his purpose. His age may have been fifty or\r\nthereabouts, for his black, curly hair was thickly shot with grey. His\r\nface in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy brows and\r\naggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible expression\r\nwhen moved to anger. He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his lap,\r\nand his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with his keen,\r\ntwinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings.\r\nIt seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and\r\ncontained countenance. Once he looked up at me with a gleam of\r\nsomething like humour in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Jonathan Small,\u201d said Holmes, lighting a cigar, \u201cI am sorry that\r\nit has come to this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so am I, sir,\u201d he answered, frankly. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that I can\r\nswing over the job. I give you my word on the book that I never raised\r\nhand against Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound Tonga who shot\r\none of his cursed darts into him. I had no part in it, sir. I was as\r\ngrieved as if it had been my blood-relation. I welted the little devil\r\nwith the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done, and I could not\r\nundo it again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave a cigar,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cand you had best take a pull out of my\r\nflask, for you are very wet. How could you expect so small and weak a\r\nman as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while you\r\nwere climbing the rope?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. The truth\r\nis that I hoped to find the room clear. I knew the habits of the house\r\npretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually went down to\r\nhis supper. I shall make no secret of the business. The best defence\r\nthat I can make is just the simple truth. Now, if it had been the old\r\nmajor I would have swung for him with a light heart. I would have\r\nthought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar. But it\u2019s\r\ncursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto, with whom I\r\nhad no quarrel whatever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard. He\r\nis going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true\r\naccount of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you\r\ndo I hope that I may be of use to you. I think I can prove that the\r\npoison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached\r\nthe room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat he was, sir. I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw him\r\ngrinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through the\r\nwindow. It fairly shook me, sir. I\u2019d have half killed Tonga for it if\r\nhe had not scrambled off. That was how he came to leave his club, and\r\nsome of his darts too, as he tells me, which I dare say helped to put\r\nyou on our track; though how you kept on it is more than I can tell. I\r\ndon\u2019t feel no malice against you for it. But it does seem a queer\r\nthing,\u201d he added, with a bitter smile, \u201cthat I who have a fair claim to\r\nnigh upon half a million of money should spend the first half of my\r\nlife building a breakwater in the Andamans, and am like to spend the\r\nother half digging drains at Dartmoor. It was an evil day for me when\r\nfirst I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet and had to do with the\r\nAgra treasure, which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the\r\nman who owned it. To him it brought murder, to Major Sholto it brought\r\nfear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery for life.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders\r\ninto the tiny cabin. \u201cQuite a family party,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think I\r\nshall have a pull at that flask, Holmes. Well, I think we may all\r\ncongratulate each other. Pity we didn\u2019t take the other alive; but there\r\nwas no choice. I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it rather\r\nfine. It was all we could do to overhaul her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll is well that ends well,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cBut I certainly did not\r\nknow that the _Aurora_ was such a clipper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSmith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that\r\nif he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never\r\nhave caught her. He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNeither he did,\u201d cried our prisoner,\u2014\u201cnot a word. I chose his launch\r\nbecause I heard that she was a flier. We told him nothing, but we paid\r\nhim well, and he was to get something handsome if we reached our\r\nvessel, the _Esmeralda_, at Gravesend, outward bound for the Brazils.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him.\r\nIf we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick in\r\ncondemning them.\u201d It was amusing to notice how the consequential Jones\r\nwas already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the\r\ncapture. From the slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes\u2019s\r\nface, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently,\u201d said Jones, \u201cand shall land\r\nyou, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box. I need hardly tell you that I\r\nam taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this. It is\r\nmost irregular; but of course an agreement is an agreement. I must,\r\nhowever, as a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since you\r\nhave so valuable a charge. You will drive, no doubt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I shall drive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first. You\r\nwill have to break it open. Where is the key, my man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the bottom of the river,\u201d said Small, shortly.\r\n\r\n\u201cHum! There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. We have\r\nhad work enough already through you. However, doctor, I need not warn\r\nyou to be careful. Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street\r\nrooms. You will find us there, on our way to the station.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff,\r\ngenial inspector as my companion. A quarter of an hour\u2019s drive brought\r\nus to Mrs. Cecil Forrester\u2019s. The servant seemed surprised at so late a\r\nvisitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she explained,\r\nand likely to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was in the\r\ndrawing-room: so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving the\r\nobliging inspector in the cab.\r\n\r\nShe was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white\r\ndiaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and\r\nwaist. The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned back\r\nin the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and tinting\r\nwith a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair. One\r\nwhite arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and her whole\r\npose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. At the sound of my\r\nfoot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright flush of\r\nsurprise and of pleasure coloured her pale cheeks.\r\n\r\n\u201cI heard a cab drive up,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought that Mrs. Forrester had\r\ncome back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you. What\r\nnews have you brought me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have brought something better than news,\u201d said I, putting down the\r\nbox upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though my\r\nheart was heavy within me. \u201cI have brought you something which is worth\r\nall the news in the world. I have brought you a fortune.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe glanced at the iron box. \u201cIs that the treasure, then?\u201d she asked,\r\ncoolly enough.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, this is the great Agra treasure. Half of it is yours and half is\r\nThaddeus Sholto\u2019s. You will have a couple of hundred thousand each.\r\nThink of that! An annuity of ten thousand pounds. There will be few\r\nricher young ladies in England. Is it not glorious?\u201d\r\n\r\nI think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and that\r\nshe detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her\r\neyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I have it,\u201d said she, \u201cI owe it to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d I answered, \u201cnot to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes.\r\nWith all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue\r\nwhich has taxed even his analytical genius. As it was, we very nearly\r\nlost it at the last moment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson,\u201d said she.\r\n\r\nI narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her\r\nlast,\u2014Holmes\u2019s new method of search, the discovery of the _Aurora_, the\r\nappearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and the\r\nwild chase down the Thames. She listened with parted lips and shining\r\neyes to my recital of our adventures. When I spoke of the dart which\r\nhad so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I feared that she\r\nwas about to faint.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is nothing,\u201d she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water. \u201cI\r\nam all right again. It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed my\r\nfriends in such horrible peril.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is all over,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt was nothing. I will tell you no\r\nmore gloomy details. Let us turn to something brighter. There is the\r\ntreasure. What could be brighter than that? I got leave to bring it\r\nwith me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would be of the greatest interest to me,\u201d she said. There was no\r\neagerness in her voice, however. It had struck her, doubtless, that it\r\nmight seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which\r\nhad cost so much to win.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a pretty box!\u201d she said, stooping over it. \u201cThis is Indian work,\r\nI suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; it is Benares metal-work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so heavy!\u201d she exclaimed, trying to raise it. \u201cThe box alone must\r\nbe of some value. Where is the key?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSmall threw it into the Thames,\u201d I answered. \u201cI must borrow Mrs.\r\nForrester\u2019s poker.\u201d There was in the front a thick and broad hasp,\r\nwrought in the image of a sitting Buddha. Under this I thrust the end\r\nof the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang open\r\nwith a loud snap. With trembling fingers I flung back the lid. We both\r\nstood gazing in astonishment. The box was empty!\r\n\r\nNo wonder that it was heavy. The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch\r\nthick all round. It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest\r\nconstructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or crumb\r\nof metal or jewelry lay within it. It was absolutely and completely\r\nempty.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe treasure is lost,\u201d said Miss Morstan, calmly.\r\n\r\nAs I listened to the words and realised what they meant, a great shadow\r\nseemed to pass from my soul. I did not know how this Agra treasure had\r\nweighed me down, until now that it was finally removed. It was selfish,\r\nno doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realise nothing save that the\r\ngolden barrier was gone from between us. \u201cThank God!\u201d I ejaculated from\r\nmy very heart.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me with a quick, questioning smile. \u201cWhy do you say\r\nthat?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause you are within my reach again,\u201d I said, taking her hand. She\r\ndid not withdraw it. \u201cBecause I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a man\r\nloved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my lips. Now\r\nthat they are gone I can tell you how I love you. That is why I said,\r\n\u2018Thank God.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I say, \u2018Thank God,\u2019 too,\u201d she whispered, as I drew her to my\r\nside. Whoever had lost a treasure, I knew that night that I had gained\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\nThe Strange Story of Jonathan Small\r\n\r\n\r\nA very patient man was that inspector in the cab, for it was a weary\r\ntime before I rejoined him. His face clouded over when I showed him the\r\nempty box.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere goes the reward!\u201d said he, gloomily. \u201cWhere there is no money\r\nthere is no pay. This night\u2019s work would have been worth a tenner each\r\nto Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man,\u201d I said. \u201cHe will see that you are\r\nrewarded, treasure or no.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe inspector shook his head despondently, however. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad job,\u201d\r\nhe repeated; \u201cand so Mr. Athelney Jones will think.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank\r\nenough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. They\r\nhad only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had\r\nchanged their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon\r\nthe way. My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual listless\r\nexpression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden\r\nleg cocked over his sound one. As I exhibited the empty box he leaned\r\nback in his chair and laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is your doing, Small,\u201d said Athelney Jones, angrily.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it,\u201d he\r\ncried, exultantly. \u201cIt is my treasure; and if I can\u2019t have the loot\r\nI\u2019ll take darned good care that no one else does. I tell you that no\r\nliving man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the\r\nAndaman convict-barracks and myself. I know now that I cannot have the\r\nuse of it, and I know that they cannot. I have acted all through for\r\nthem as much as for myself. It\u2019s been the sign of four with us always.\r\nWell I know that they would have had me do just what I have done, and\r\nthrow the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to kith or kin\r\nof Sholto or of Morstan. It was not to make them rich that we did for\r\nAchmet. You\u2019ll find the treasure where the key is, and where little\r\nTonga is. When I saw that your launch must catch us, I put the loot\r\naway in a safe place. There are no rupees for you this journey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are deceiving us, Small,\u201d said Athelney Jones, sternly. \u201cIf you\r\nhad wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have been\r\neasier for you to have thrown box and all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEasier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover,\u201d he answered,\r\nwith a shrewd, sidelong look. \u201cThe man that was clever enough to hunt\r\nme down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a\r\nriver. Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be a\r\nharder job. It went to my heart to do it, though. I was half mad when\r\nyou came up with us. However, there\u2019s no good grieving over it. I\u2019ve\r\nhad ups in my life, and I\u2019ve had downs, but I\u2019ve learned not to cry\r\nover spilled milk.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very serious matter, Small,\u201d said the detective. \u201cIf you had\r\nhelped justice, instead of thwarting it in this way, you would have had\r\na better chance at your trial.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJustice!\u201d snarled the ex-convict. \u201cA pretty justice! Whose loot is\r\nthis, if it is not ours? Where is the justice that I should give it up\r\nto those who have never earned it? Look how I have earned it! Twenty\r\nlong years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work under the\r\nmangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts, bitten\r\nby mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursed black-faced\r\npoliceman who loved to take it out of a white man. That was how I\r\nearned the Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justice because I\r\ncannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that another may\r\nenjoy it! I would rather swing a score of times, or have one of Tonga\u2019s\r\ndarts in my hide, than live in a convict\u2019s cell and feel that another\r\nman is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine.\u201d\r\nSmall had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this came out in a wild\r\nwhirl of words, while his eyes blazed, and the handcuffs clanked\r\ntogether with the impassioned movement of his hands. I could\r\nunderstand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the man, that it was\r\nno groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed Major Sholto when\r\nhe first learned that the injured convict was upon his track.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou forget that we know nothing of all this,\u201d said Holmes quietly. \u201cWe\r\nhave not heard your story, and we cannot tell how far justice may\r\noriginally have been on your side.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can see that\r\nI have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists. Still,\r\nI bear no grudge for that. It is all fair and above-board. If you want\r\nto hear my story I have no wish to hold it back. What I say to you is\r\nGod\u2019s truth, every word of it. Thank you; you can put the glass beside\r\nme here, and I\u2019ll put my lips to it if I am dry.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am a Worcestershire man myself,\u2014born near Pershore. I dare say you\r\nwould find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look. I\r\nhave often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is that\r\nI was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they would\r\nbe so very glad to see me. They were all steady, chapel-going folk,\r\nsmall farmers, well-known and respected over the country-side, while I\r\nwas always a bit of a rover. At last, however, when I was about\r\neighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a mess over a\r\ngirl, and could only get out of it again by taking the Queen\u2019s shilling\r\nand joining the 3rd Buffs, which was just starting for India.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t destined to do much soldiering, however. I had just got past\r\nthe goose-step, and learned to handle my musket, when I was fool enough\r\nto go swimming in the Ganges. Luckily for me, my company sergeant, John\r\nHolder, was in the water at the same time, and he was one of the finest\r\nswimmers in the service. A crocodile took me, just as I was half-way\r\nacross, and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon could have\r\ndone it, just above the knee. What with the shock and the loss of\r\nblood, I fainted, and should have drowned if Holder had not caught hold\r\nof me and paddled for the bank. I was five months in hospital over it,\r\nand when at last I was able to limp out of it with this timber toe\r\nstrapped to my stump I found myself invalided out of the army and\r\nunfitted for any active occupation.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my luck at this time, for I\r\nwas a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year. However, my\r\nmisfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. A man named Abel\r\nWhite, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted an overseer\r\nto look after his coolies and keep them up to their work. He happened\r\nto be a friend of our colonel\u2019s, who had taken an interest in me since\r\nthe accident. To make a long story short, the colonel recommended me\r\nstrongly for the post and, as the work was mostly to be done on\r\nhorseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough knee left to\r\nkeep good grip on the saddle. What I had to do was to ride over the\r\nplantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked, and to report the\r\nidlers. The pay was fair, I had comfortable quarters, and altogether I\r\nwas content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo-planting. Mr.\r\nAbel White was a kind man, and he would often drop into my little\r\nshanty and smoke a pipe with me, for white folk out there feel their\r\nhearts warm to each other as they never do here at home.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I was never in luck\u2019s way long. Suddenly, without a note of\r\nwarning, the great mutiny broke upon us. One month India lay as still\r\nand peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were\r\ntwo hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was a\r\nperfect hell. Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,\u2014a deal more\r\nthan I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. I only know what\r\nI saw with my own eyes. Our plantation was at a place called Muttra,\r\nnear the border of the Northwest Provinces. Night after night the whole\r\nsky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day we had\r\nsmall companies of Europeans passing through our estate with their\r\nwives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest\r\ntroops. Mr. Abel White was an obstinate man. He had it in his head that\r\nthe affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as\r\nsuddenly as it had sprung up. There he sat on his veranda, drinking\r\nwhiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze\r\nabout him. Of course we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his wife,\r\nused to do the book-work and the managing. Well, one fine day the crash\r\ncame. I had been away on a distant plantation, and was riding slowly\r\nhome in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all huddled\r\ntogether at the bottom of a steep nullah. I rode down to see what it\r\nwas, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson\u2019s\r\nwife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native dogs.\r\nA little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face,\r\nquite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying\r\nacross each other in front of him. I reined up my horse, wondering\r\nwhich way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling\r\nup from Abel White\u2019s bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through\r\nthe roof. I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would\r\nonly throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter. From where I\r\nstood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats\r\nstill on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house. Some\r\nof them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head; so I\r\nbroke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at night safe\r\nwithin the walls at Agra.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs it proved, however, there was no great safety there, either. The\r\nwhole country was up like a swarm of bees. Wherever the English could\r\ncollect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns\r\ncommanded. Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives. It was a fight\r\nof the millions against the hundreds; and the cruellest part of it was\r\nthat these men that we fought against, foot, horse, and gunners, were\r\nour own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained, handling our own\r\nweapons, and blowing our own bugle-calls. At Agra there were the 3rd\r\nBengal Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a battery of\r\nartillery. A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed,\r\nand this I joined, wooden leg and all. We went out to meet the rebels\r\nat Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back for a time, but our\r\npowder gave out, and we had to fall back upon the city.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing but the worst news came to us from every side,\u2014which is not to\r\nbe wondered at, for if you look at the map you will see that we were\r\nright in the heart of it. Lucknow is rather better than a hundred miles\r\nto the east, and Cawnpore about as far to the south. From every point\r\non the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and outrage.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe city of Agra is a great place, swarming with fanatics and fierce\r\ndevil-worshippers of all sorts. Our handful of men were lost among the\r\nnarrow, winding streets. Our leader moved across the river, therefore,\r\nand took up his position in the old fort at Agra. I don\u2019t know if any\r\nof you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort. It\r\nis a very queer place,\u2014the queerest that ever I was in, and I have been\r\nin some rum corners, too. First of all, it is enormous in size. I\r\nshould think that the enclosure must be acres and acres. There is a\r\nmodern part, which took all our garrison, women, children, stores, and\r\neverything else, with plenty of room over. But the modern part is\r\nnothing like the size of the old quarter, where nobody goes, and which\r\nis given over to the scorpions and the centipedes. It is all full of\r\ngreat deserted halls, and winding passages, and long corridors twisting\r\nin and out, so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it. For\r\nthis reason it was seldom that any one went into it, though now and\r\nagain a party with torches might go exploring.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe river washes along the front of the old fort, and so protects it,\r\nbut on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to be\r\nguarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which was\r\nactually held by our troops. We were short-handed, with hardly men\r\nenough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns. It was\r\nimpossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one of\r\nthe innumerable gates. What we did was to organise a central\r\nguard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under the\r\ncharge of one white man and two or three natives. I was selected to\r\ntake charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door\r\nupon the southwest side of the building. Two Sikh troopers were placed\r\nunder my command, and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire\r\nmy musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central\r\nguard. As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and as\r\nthe space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and\r\ncorridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time\r\nto be of any use in case of an actual attack.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, since\r\nI was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that. For two nights I\r\nkept the watch with my Punjaubees. They were tall, fierce-looking\r\nchaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, both old fighting-men\r\nwho had borne arms against us at Chilian-wallah. They could talk\r\nEnglish pretty well, but I could get little out of them. They preferred\r\nto stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo. For\r\nmyself, I used to stand outside the gateway, looking down on the broad,\r\nwinding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city. The\r\nbeating of drums, the rattle of tomtoms, and the yells and howls of the\r\nrebels, drunk with opium and with bang, were enough to remind us all\r\nnight of our dangerous neighbours across the stream. Every two hours\r\nthe officer of the night used to come round to all the posts, to make\r\nsure that all was well.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small, driving\r\nrain. It was dreary work standing in the gateway hour after hour in\r\nsuch weather. I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk, but\r\nwithout much success. At two in the morning the rounds passed, and\r\nbroke for a moment the weariness of the night. Finding that my\r\ncompanions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe, and\r\nlaid down my musket to strike the match. In an instant the two Sikhs\r\nwere upon me. One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at my\r\nhead, while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore between\r\nhis teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a step.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy first thought was that these fellows were in league with the\r\nrebels, and that this was the beginning of an assault. If our door were\r\nin the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the women and\r\nchildren be treated as they were in Cawnpore. Maybe you gentlemen think\r\nthat I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you my word\r\nthat when I thought of that, though I felt the point of the knife at my\r\nthroat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream, if it\r\nwas my last one, which might alarm the main guard. The man who held me\r\nseemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it, he\r\nwhispered, \u2018Don\u2019t make a noise. The fort is safe enough. There are no\r\nrebel dogs on this side of the river.\u2019 There was the ring of truth in\r\nwhat he said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man. I\r\ncould read it in the fellow\u2019s brown eyes. I waited, therefore, in\r\nsilence, to see what it was that they wanted from me.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Listen to me, Sahib,\u2019 said the taller and fiercer of the pair, the\r\none whom they called Abdullah Khan. \u2018You must either be with us now or\r\nyou must be silenced forever. The thing is too great a one for us to\r\nhesitate. Either you are heart and soul with us on your oath on the\r\ncross of the Christians, or your body this night shall be thrown into\r\nthe ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army.\r\nThere is no middle way. Which is it to be, death or life? We can only\r\ngive you three minutes to decide, for the time is passing, and all must\r\nbe done before the rounds come again.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018How can I decide?\u2019 said I. \u2018You have not told me what you want of me.\r\nBut I tell you now that if it is anything against the safety of the\r\nfort I will have no truck with it, so you can drive home your knife and\r\nwelcome.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is nothing against the fort,\u2019 said he. \u2018We only ask you to do that\r\nwhich your countrymen come to this land for. We ask you to be rich. If\r\nyou will be one of us this night, we will swear to you upon the naked\r\nknife, and by the threefold oath which no Sikh was ever known to break,\r\nthat you shall have your fair share of the loot. A quarter of the\r\ntreasure shall be yours. We can say no fairer.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But what is the treasure, then?\u2019 I asked. \u2018I am as ready to be rich\r\nas you can be, if you will but show me how it can be done.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You will swear, then,\u2019 said he, \u2018by the bones of your father, by the\r\nhonour of your mother, by the cross of your faith, to raise no hand and\r\nspeak no word against us, either now or afterwards?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I will swear it,\u2019 I answered, \u2018provided that the fort is not\r\nendangered.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then my comrade and I will swear that you shall have a quarter of the\r\ntreasure which shall be equally divided among the four of us.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018There are but three,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No; Dost Akbar must have his share. We can tell the tale to you while\r\nwe await them. Do you stand at the gate, Mahomet Singh, and give notice\r\nof their coming. The thing stands thus, Sahib, and I tell it to you\r\nbecause I know that an oath is binding upon a Feringhee, and that we\r\nmay trust you. Had you been a lying Hindoo, though you had sworn by all\r\nthe gods in their false temples, your blood would have been upon the\r\nknife, and your body in the water. But the Sikh knows the Englishman,\r\nand the Englishman knows the Sikh. Hearken, then, to what I have to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018There is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth,\r\nthough his lands are small. Much has come to him from his father, and\r\nmore still he has set by himself, for he is of a low nature and hoards\r\nhis gold rather than spend it. When the troubles broke out he would be\r\nfriends both with the lion and the tiger,\u2014with the Sepoy and with the\r\nCompany\u2019s Raj. Soon, however, it seemed to him that the white men\u2019s day\r\nwas come, for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of\r\ntheir death and their overthrow. Yet, being a careful man, he made such\r\nplans that, come what might, half at least of his treasure should be\r\nleft to him. That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in the\r\nvaults of his palace, but the most precious stones and the choicest\r\npearls that he had he put in an iron box, and sent it by a trusty\r\nservant who, under the guise of a merchant, should take it to the fort\r\nat Agra, there to lie until the land is at peace. Thus, if the rebels\r\nwon he would have his money, but if the Company conquered his jewels\r\nwould be saved to him. Having thus divided his hoard, he threw himself\r\ninto the cause of the Sepoys, since they were strong upon his borders.\r\nBy doing this, mark you, Sahib, his property becomes the due of those\r\nwho have been true to their salt.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018This pretended merchant, who travels under the name of Achmet, is now\r\nin the city of Agra, and desires to gain his way into the fort. He has\r\nwith him as travelling-companion my foster-brother Dost Akbar, who\r\nknows his secret. Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead him to a\r\nside-postern of the fort, and has chosen this one for his purpose. Here\r\nhe will come presently, and here he will find Mahomet Singh and myself\r\nawaiting him. The place is lonely, and none shall know of his coming.\r\nThe world shall know of the merchant Achmet no more, but the great\r\ntreasure of the rajah shall be divided among us. What say you to it,\r\nSahib?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cIn Worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacred thing;\r\nbut it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you and\r\nyou have been used to meeting death at every turn. Whether Achmet the\r\nmerchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me, but at the\r\ntalk about the treasure my heart turned to it, and I thought of what I\r\nmight do in the old country with it, and how my folk would stare when\r\nthey saw their ne\u2019er-do-well coming back with his pockets full of gold\r\nmoidores. I had, therefore, already made up my mind. Abdullah Khan,\r\nhowever, thinking that I hesitated, pressed the matter more closely.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Consider, Sahib,\u2019 said he, \u2018that if this man is taken by the\r\ncommandant he will be hung or shot, and his jewels taken by the\r\ngovernment, so that no man will be a rupee the better for them. Now,\r\nsince we do the taking of him, why should we not do the rest as well?\r\nThe jewels will be as well with us as in the Company\u2019s coffers. There\r\nwill be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs. No\r\none can know about the matter, for here we are cut off from all men.\r\nWhat could be better for the purpose? Say again, then, Sahib, whether\r\nyou are with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am with you heart and soul,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is well,\u2019 he answered, handing me back my firelock. \u2018You see that\r\nwe trust you, for your word, like ours, is not to be broken. We have\r\nnow only to wait for my brother and the merchant.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Does your brother know, then, of what you will do?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The plan is his. He has devised it. We will go to the gate and share\r\nthe watch with Mahomet Singh.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe rain was still falling steadily, for it was just the beginning of\r\nthe wet season. Brown, heavy clouds were drifting across the sky, and\r\nit was hard to see more than a stone-cast. A deep moat lay in front of\r\nour door, but the water was in places nearly dried up, and it could\r\neasily be crossed. It was strange to me to be standing there with those\r\ntwo wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his death.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side\r\nof the moat. It vanished among the mound-heaps, and then appeared again\r\ncoming slowly in our direction.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Here they are!\u2019 I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You will challenge him, Sahib, as usual,\u2019 whispered Abdullah. \u2018Give\r\nhim no cause for fear. Send us in with him, and we shall do the rest\r\nwhile you stay here on guard. Have the lantern ready to uncover, that\r\nwe may be sure that it is indeed the man.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe light had flickered onwards, now stopping and now advancing, until\r\nI could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat. I let\r\nthem scramble down the sloping bank, splash through the mire, and climb\r\nhalf-way up to the gate, before I challenged them.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Who goes there?\u2019 said I, in a subdued voice.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Friends,\u2019 came the answer. I uncovered my lantern and threw a flood\r\nof light upon them. The first was an enormous Sikh, with a black beard\r\nwhich swept nearly down to his cummerbund. Outside of a show I have\r\nnever seen so tall a man. The other was a little, fat, round fellow,\r\nwith a great yellow turban, and a bundle in his hand, done up in a\r\nshawl. He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear, for his hands\r\ntwitched as if he had the ague, and his head kept turning to left and\r\nright with two bright little twinkling eyes, like a mouse when he\r\nventures out from his hole. It gave me the chills to think of killing\r\nhim, but I thought of the treasure, and my heart set as hard as a flint\r\nwithin me. When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy\r\nand came running up towards me.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Your protection, Sahib,\u2019 he panted,\u2014\u2018your protection for the unhappy\r\nmerchant Achmet. I have travelled across Rajpootana that I might seek\r\nthe shelter of the fort at Agra. I have been robbed and beaten and\r\nabused because I have been the friend of the Company. It is a blessed\r\nnight this when I am once more in safety,\u2014I and my poor possessions.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What have you in the bundle?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018An iron box,\u2019 he answered, \u2018which contains one or two little family\r\nmatters which are of no value to others, but which I should be sorry to\r\nlose. Yet I am not a beggar; and I shall reward you, young Sahib, and\r\nyour governor also, if he will give me the shelter I ask.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI could not trust myself to speak longer with the man. The more I\r\nlooked at his fat, frightened face, the harder did it seem that we\r\nshould slay him in cold blood. It was best to get it over.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Take him to the main guard,\u2019 said I. The two Sikhs closed in upon him\r\non each side, and the giant walked behind, while they marched in\r\nthrough the dark gateway. Never was a man so compassed round with\r\ndeath. I remained at the gateway with the lantern.\r\n\r\n\u201cI could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through\r\nthe lonely corridors. Suddenly it ceased, and I heard voices, and a\r\nscuffle, with the sound of blows. A moment later there came, to my\r\nhorror, a rush of footsteps coming in my direction, with the loud\r\nbreathing of a running man. I turned my lantern down the long, straight\r\npassage, and there was the fat man, running like the wind, with a smear\r\nof blood across his face, and close at his heels, bounding like a\r\ntiger, the great black-bearded Sikh, with a knife flashing in his hand.\r\nI have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant. He was\r\ngaining on the Sikh, and I could see that if he once passed me and got\r\nto the open air he would save himself yet. My heart softened to him,\r\nbut again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter. I cast\r\nmy firelock between his legs as he raced past, and he rolled twice over\r\nlike a shot rabbit. Ere he could stagger to his feet the Sikh was upon\r\nhim, and buried his knife twice in his side. The man never uttered moan\r\nnor moved muscle, but lay were he had fallen. I think myself that he\r\nmay have broken his neck with the fall. You see, gentlemen, that I am\r\nkeeping my promise. I am telling you every work of the business just\r\nexactly as it happened, whether it is in my favour or not.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and held out his manacled hands for the whiskey-and-water\r\nwhich Holmes had brewed for him. For myself, I confess that I had now\r\nconceived the utmost horror of the man, not only for this cold-blooded\r\nbusiness in which he had been concerned, but even more for the somewhat\r\nflippant and careless way in which he narrated it. Whatever punishment\r\nwas in store for him, I felt that he might expect no sympathy from me.\r\nSherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their hands upon their knees, deeply\r\ninterested in the story, but with the same disgust written upon their\r\nfaces. He may have observed it, for there was a touch of defiance in\r\nhis voice and manner as he proceeded.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was all very bad, no doubt,\u201d said he. \u201cI should like to know how\r\nmany fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when\r\nthey knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains.\r\nBesides, it was my life or his when once he was in the fort. If he had\r\ngot out, the whole business would come to light, and I should have been\r\ncourt-martialled and shot as likely as not; for people were not very\r\nlenient at a time like that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on with your story,\u201d said Holmes, shortly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we carried him in, Abdullah, Akbar, and I. A fine weight he was,\r\ntoo, for all that he was so short. Mahomet Singh was left to guard the\r\ndoor. We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already prepared. It\r\nwas some distance off, where a winding passage leads to a great empty\r\nhall, the brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces. The earth\r\nfloor had sunk in at one place, making a natural grave, so we left\r\nAchmet the merchant there, having first covered him over with loose\r\nbricks. This done, we all went back to the treasure.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked. The box was\r\nthe same which now lies open upon your table. A key was hung by a\r\nsilken cord to that carved handle upon the top. We opened it, and the\r\nlight of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have\r\nread of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore. It was\r\nblinding to look upon them. When we had feasted our eyes we took them\r\nall out and made a list of them. There were one hundred and forty-three\r\ndiamonds of the first water, including one which has been called, I\r\nbelieve, \u2018the Great Mogul\u2019 and is said to be the second largest stone\r\nin existence. Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds, and one\r\nhundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however, were small. There\r\nwere forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sapphires, sixty-one agates,\r\nand a great quantity of beryls, onyxes, cats\u2019-eyes, turquoises, and\r\nother stones, the very names of which I did not know at the time,\r\nthough I have become more familiar with them since. Besides this, there\r\nwere nearly three hundred very fine pearls, twelve of which were set in\r\na gold coronet. By the way, these last had been taken out of the chest\r\nand were not there when I recovered it.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and\r\ncarried them to the gateway to show them to Mahomet Singh. Then we\r\nsolemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our\r\nsecret. We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country\r\nshould be at peace again, and then to divide it equally among\r\nourselves. There was no use dividing it at present, for if gems of such\r\nvalue were found upon us it would cause suspicion, and there was no\r\nprivacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them. We carried\r\nthe box, therefore, into the same hall where we had buried the body,\r\nand there, under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall, we made a\r\nhollow and put our treasure. We made careful note of the place, and\r\nnext day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and put the sign of the\r\nfour of us at the bottom, for we had sworn that we should each always\r\nact for all, so that none might take advantage. That is an oath that I\r\ncan put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the Indian\r\nmutiny. After Wilson took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow the back\r\nof the business was broken. Fresh troops came pouring in, and Nana\r\nSahib made himself scarce over the frontier. A flying column under\r\nColonel Greathed came round to Agra and cleared the Pandies away from\r\nit. Peace seemed to be settling upon the country, and we four were\r\nbeginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off\r\nwith our shares of the plunder. In a moment, however, our hopes were\r\nshattered by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt came about in this way. When the rajah put his jewels into the\r\nhands of Achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man.\r\nThey are suspicious folk in the East, however: so what does this rajah\r\ndo but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the\r\nspy upon the first? This second man was ordered never to let Achmet out\r\nof his sight, and he followed him like his shadow. He went after him\r\nthat night and saw him pass through the doorway. Of course he thought\r\nhe had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admission there\r\nhimself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet. This seemed to him\r\nso strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who brought\r\nit to the ears of the commandant. A thorough search was quickly made,\r\nand the body was discovered. Thus at the very moment that we thought\r\nthat all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a\r\ncharge of murder,\u2014three of us because we had held the gate that night,\r\nand the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the\r\nmurdered man. Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial, for\r\nthe rajah had been deposed and driven out of India: so no one had any\r\nparticular interest in them. The murder, however, was clearly made out,\r\nand it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it. The\r\nthree Sikhs got penal servitude for life, and I was condemned to death,\r\nthough my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then. There\r\nwe were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of\r\never getting out again, while we each held a secret which might have\r\nput each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it. It was\r\nenough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick and\r\nthe cuff of every petty jack-in-office, to have rice to eat and water\r\nto drink, when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside, just\r\nwaiting to be picked up. It might have driven me mad; but I was always\r\na pretty stubborn one, so I just held on and bided my time.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt last it seemed to me to have come. I was changed from Agra to\r\nMadras, and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans. There are very\r\nfew white convicts at this settlement, and, as I had behaved well from\r\nthe first, I soon found myself a sort of privileged person. I was given\r\na hut in Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopes of Mount\r\nHarriet, and I was left pretty much to myself. It is a dreary,\r\nfever-stricken place, and all beyond our little clearings was infested\r\nwith wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow a poisoned\r\ndart at us if they saw a chance. There was digging, and ditching, and\r\nyam-planting, and a dozen other things to be done, so we were busy\r\nenough all day; though in the evening we had a little time to\r\nourselves. Among other things, I learned to dispense drugs for the\r\nsurgeon, and picked up a smattering of his knowledge. All the time I\r\nwas on the lookout for a chance of escape; but it is hundreds of miles\r\nfrom any other land, and there is little or no wind in those seas: so\r\nit was a terribly difficult job to get away.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe surgeon, Dr. Somerton, was a fast, sporting young chap, and the\r\nother young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play\r\ncards. The surgery, where I used to make up my drugs, was next to his\r\nsitting-room, with a small window between us. Often, if I felt\r\nlonesome, I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and then,\r\nstanding there, I could hear their talk and watch their play. I am fond\r\nof a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as having one to\r\nwatch the others. There was Major Sholto, Captain Morstan, and\r\nLieutenant Bromley Brown, who were in command of the native troops, and\r\nthere was the surgeon himself, and two or three prison-officials,\r\ncrafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game. A very snug little\r\nparty they used to make.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there was one thing which very soon struck me, and that was that\r\nthe soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win. Mind, I\r\ndon\u2019t say that there was anything unfair, but so it was. These\r\nprison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had\r\nbeen at the Andamans, and they knew each other\u2019s game to a point, while\r\nthe others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down\r\nanyhow. Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men, and the\r\npoorer they got the more keen they were to play. Major Sholto was the\r\nhardest hit. He used to pay in notes and gold at first, but soon it\r\ncame to notes of hand and for big sums. He sometimes would win for a\r\nfew deals, just to give him heart, and then the luck would set in\r\nagainst him worse than ever. All day he would wander about as black as\r\nthunder, and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne night he lost even more heavily than usual. I was sitting in my\r\nhut when he and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way to\r\ntheir quarters. They were bosom friends, those two, and never far\r\napart. The major was raving about his losses.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s all up, Morstan,\u2019 he was saying, as they passed my hut. \u2018I shall\r\nhave to send in my papers. I am a ruined man.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Nonsense, old chap!\u2019 said the other, slapping him upon the shoulder.\r\n\u2018I\u2019ve had a nasty facer myself, but\u2014\u2019 That was all I could hear, but it\r\nwas enough to set me thinking.\r\n\r\n\u201cA couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach: so I\r\ntook the chance of speaking to him.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I wish to have your advice, major,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, Small, what is it?\u2019 he asked, taking his cheroot from his lips.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I wanted to ask you, sir,\u2019 said I, \u2018who is the proper person to whom\r\nhidden treasure should be handed over. I know where half a million\r\nworth lies, and, as I cannot use it myself, I thought perhaps the best\r\nthing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper\r\nauthorities, and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for\r\nme.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Half a million, Small?\u2019 he gasped, looking hard at me to see if I was\r\nin earnest.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Quite that, sir,\u2014in jewels and pearls. It lies there ready for any\r\none. And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed\r\nand cannot hold property, so that it belongs to the first comer.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018To government, Small,\u2019 he stammered,\u2014\u2018to government.\u2019 But he said it\r\nin a halting fashion, and I knew in my heart that I had got him.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You think, then, sir, that I should give the information to the\r\nGovernor-General?\u2019 said I, quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, well, you must not do anything rash, or that you might repent.\r\nLet me hear all about it, Small. Give me the facts.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI told him the whole story, with small changes so that he could not\r\nidentify the places. When I had finished he stood stock still and full\r\nof thought. I could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a\r\nstruggle going on within him.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018This is a very important matter, Small,\u2019 he said, at last. \u2018You must\r\nnot say a word to any one about it, and I shall see you again soon.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo nights later he and his friend Captain Morstan came to my hut in\r\nthe dead of the night with a lantern.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your own\r\nlips, Small,\u2019 said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cI repeated it as I had told it before.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It rings true, eh?\u2019 said he. \u2018It\u2019s good enough to act upon?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cCaptain Morstan nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Look here, Small,\u2019 said the major. \u2018We have been talking it over, my\r\nfriend here and I, and we have come to the conclusion that this secret\r\nof yours is hardly a government matter, after all, but is a private\r\nconcern of your own, which of course you have the power of disposing of\r\nas you think best. Now, the question is, what price would you ask for\r\nit? We might be inclined to take it up, and at least look into it, if\r\nwe could agree as to terms.\u2019 He tried to speak in a cool, careless way,\r\nbut his eyes were shining with excitement and greed.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, as to that, gentlemen,\u2019 I answered, trying also to be cool, but\r\nfeeling as excited as he did, \u2018there is only one bargain which a man in\r\nmy position can make. I shall want you to help me to my freedom, and to\r\nhelp my three companions to theirs. We shall then take you into\r\npartnership, and give you a fifth share to divide between you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Hum!\u2019 said he. \u2018A fifth share! That is not very tempting.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It would come to fifty thousand apiece,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But how can we gain your freedom? You know very well that you ask an\r\nimpossibility.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Nothing of the sort,\u2019 I answered. \u2018I have thought it all out to the\r\nlast detail. The only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fit\r\nfor the voyage, and no provisions to last us for so long a time. There\r\nare plenty of little yachts and yawls at Calcutta or Madras which would\r\nserve our turn well. Do you bring one over. We shall engage to get\r\naboard her by night, and if you will drop us on any part of the Indian\r\ncoast you will have done your part of the bargain.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018If there were only one,\u2019 he said.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018None or all,\u2019 I answered. \u2018We have sworn it. The four of us must\r\nalways act together.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You see, Morstan,\u2019 said he, \u2018Small is a man of his word. He does not\r\nflinch from his friend. I think we may very well trust him.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s a dirty business,\u2019 the other answered. \u2018Yet, as you say, the\r\nmoney would save our commissions handsomely.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, Small,\u2019 said the major, \u2018we must, I suppose, try and meet you.\r\nWe must first, of course, test the truth of your story. Tell me where\r\nthe box is hid, and I shall get leave of absence and go back to India\r\nin the monthly relief-boat to inquire into the affair.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Not so fast,\u2019 said I, growing colder as he got hot. \u2018I must have the\r\nconsent of my three comrades. I tell you that it is four or none with\r\nus.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Nonsense!\u2019 he broke in. \u2018What have three black fellows to do with our\r\nagreement?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Black or blue,\u2019 said I, \u2018they are in with me, and we all go\r\ntogether.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, the matter ended by a second meeting, at which Mahomet Singh,\r\nAbdullah Khan, and Dost Akbar were all present. We talked the matter\r\nover again, and at last we came to an arrangement. We were to provide\r\nboth the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort and mark the\r\nplace in the wall where the treasure was hid. Major Sholto was to go to\r\nIndia to test our story. If he found the box he was to leave it there,\r\nto send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage, which was to lie\r\noff Rutland Island, and to which we were to make our way, and finally\r\nto return to his duties. Captain Morstan was then to apply for leave of\r\nabsence, to meet us at Agra, and there we were to have a final division\r\nof the treasure, he taking the major\u2019s share as well as his own. All\r\nthis we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or\r\nthe lips utter. I sat up all night with paper and ink, and by the\r\nmorning I had the two charts all ready, signed with the sign of\r\nfour,\u2014that is, of Abdullah, Akbar, Mahomet, and myself.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, gentlemen, I weary you with my long story, and I know that my\r\nfriend Mr. Jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey. I\u2019ll\r\nmake it as short as I can. The villain Sholto went off to India, but he\r\nnever came back again. Captain Morstan showed me his name among a list\r\nof passengers in one of the mail-boats very shortly afterwards. His\r\nuncle had died, leaving him a fortune, and he had left the army, yet he\r\ncould stoop to treat five men as he had treated us. Morstan went over\r\nto Agra shortly afterwards, and found, as we expected, that the\r\ntreasure was indeed gone. The scoundrel had stolen it all, without\r\ncarrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret.\r\nFrom that day I lived only for vengeance. I thought of it by day and I\r\nnursed it by night. It became an overpowering, absorbing passion with\r\nme. I cared nothing for the law,\u2014nothing for the gallows. To escape, to\r\ntrack down Sholto, to have my hand upon his throat,\u2014that was my one\r\nthought. Even the Agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my\r\nmind than the slaying of Sholto.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have set my mind on many things in this life, and never one\r\nwhich I did not carry out. But it was weary years before my time came.\r\nI have told you that I had picked up something of medicine. One day\r\nwhen Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander was\r\npicked up by a convict-gang in the woods. He was sick to death, and had\r\ngone to a lonely place to die. I took him in hand, though he was as\r\nvenomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months I got him all\r\nright and able to walk. He took a kind of fancy to me then, and would\r\nhardly go back to his woods, but was always hanging about my hut. I\r\nlearned a little of his lingo from him, and this made him all the\r\nfonder of me.\r\n\r\n\u201cTonga\u2014for that was his name\u2014was a fine boatman, and owned a big, roomy\r\ncanoe of his own. When I found that he was devoted to me and would do\r\nanything to serve me, I saw my chance of escape. I talked it over with\r\nhim. He was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an old wharf\r\nwhich was never guarded, and there he was to pick me up. I gave him\r\ndirections to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams,\r\ncocoa-nuts, and sweet potatoes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was stanch and true, was little Tonga. No man ever had a more\r\nfaithful mate. At the night named he had his boat at the wharf. As it\r\nchanced, however, there was one of the convict-guard down there,\u2014a vile\r\nPathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me. I\r\nhad always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance. It was as if fate\r\nhad placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the\r\nisland. He stood on the bank with his back to me, and his carbine on\r\nhis shoulder. I looked about for a stone to beat out his brains with,\r\nbut none could I see. Then a queer thought came into my head and showed\r\nme where I could lay my hand on a weapon. I sat down in the darkness\r\nand unstrapped my wooden leg. With three long hops I was on him. He put\r\nhis carbine to his shoulder, but I struck him full, and knocked the\r\nwhole front of his skull in. You can see the split in the wood now\r\nwhere I hit him. We both went down together, for I could not keep my\r\nbalance, but when I got up I found him still lying quiet enough. I made\r\nfor the boat, and in an hour we were well out at sea. Tonga had brought\r\nall his earthly possessions with him, his arms and his gods. Among\r\nother things, he had a long bamboo spear, and some Andaman cocoa-nut\r\nmatting, with which I made a sort of sail. For ten days we were beating\r\nabout, trusting to luck, and on the eleventh we were picked up by a\r\ntrader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargo of Malay\r\npilgrims. They were a rum crowd, and Tonga and I soon managed to settle\r\ndown among them. They had one very good quality: they let you alone and\r\nasked no questions.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum and\r\nI went through, you would not thank me, for I would have you here until\r\nthe sun was shining. Here and there we drifted about the world,\r\nsomething always turning up to keep us from London. All the time,\r\nhowever, I never lost sight of my purpose. I would dream of Sholto at\r\nnight. A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep. At last, however,\r\nsome three or four years ago, we found ourselves in England. I had no\r\ngreat difficulty in finding where Sholto lived, and I set to work to\r\ndiscover whether he had realised the treasure, or if he still had it. I\r\nmade friends with someone who could help me,\u2014I name no names, for I\r\ndon\u2019t want to get any one else in a hole,\u2014and I soon found that he\r\nstill had the jewels. Then I tried to get at him in many ways; but he\r\nwas pretty sly, and had always two prize-fighters, besides his sons and\r\nhis khitmutgar, on guard over him.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne day, however, I got word that he was dying. I hurried at once to\r\nthe garden, mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that, and,\r\nlooking through the window, I saw him lying in his bed, with his sons\r\non each side of him. I\u2019d have come through and taken my chance with the\r\nthree of them, only even as I looked at him his jaw dropped, and I knew\r\nthat he was gone. I got into his room that same night, though, and I\r\nsearched his papers to see if there was any record of where he had\r\nhidden our jewels. There was not a line, however: so I came away,\r\nbitter and savage as a man could be. Before I left I bethought me that\r\nif I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know\r\nthat I had left some mark of our hatred; so I scrawled down the sign of\r\nthe four of us, as it had been on the chart, and I pinned it on his\r\nbosom. It was too much that he should be taken to the grave without\r\nsome token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairs\r\nand other such places as the black cannibal. He would eat raw meat and\r\ndance his war-dance: so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day\u2019s\r\nwork. I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge, and for some\r\nyears there was no news to hear, except that they were hunting for the\r\ntreasure. At last, however, came what we had waited for so long. The\r\ntreasure had been found. It was up at the top of the house, in Mr.\r\nBartholomew Sholto\u2019s chemical laboratory. I came at once and had a look\r\nat the place, but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to make\r\nmy way up to it. I learned, however, about a trap-door in the roof, and\r\nalso about Mr. Sholto\u2019s supper-hour. It seemed to me that I could\r\nmanage the thing easily through Tonga. I brought him out with me with a\r\nlong rope wound round his waist. He could climb like a cat, and he soon\r\nmade his way through the roof, but, as ill luck would have it,\r\nBartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his cost. Tonga thought he\r\nhad done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up by\r\nthe rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock. Very much\r\nsurprised was he when I made at him with the rope\u2019s end and cursed him\r\nfor a little blood-thirsty imp. I took the treasure-box and let it\r\ndown, and then slid down myself, having first left the sign of the four\r\nupon the table, to show that the jewels had come back at last to those\r\nwho had most right to them. Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed the\r\nwindow, and made off the way that he had come.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I have anything else to tell you. I had heard a\r\nwaterman speak of the speed of Smith\u2019s launch the _Aurora_, so I\r\nthought she would be a handy craft for our escape. I engaged with old\r\nSmith, and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship. He\r\nknew, no doubt, that there was some screw loose, but he was not in our\r\nsecrets. All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it\r\nis not to amuse you,\u2014for you have not done me a very good turn,\u2014but it\r\nis because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back\r\nnothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served\r\nby Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA very remarkable account,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cA fitting wind-up\r\nto an extremely interesting case. There is nothing at all new to me in\r\nthe latter part of your narrative, except that you brought your own\r\nrope. That I did not know. By the way, I had hoped that Tonga had lost\r\nall his darts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe had lost them all, sir, except the one which was in his blow-pipe\r\nat the time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, of course,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI had not thought of that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there any other point which you would like to ask about?\u201d asked the\r\nconvict, affably.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think not, thank you,\u201d my companion answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Holmes,\u201d said Athelney Jones, \u201cYou are a man to be humoured, and\r\nwe all know that you are a connoisseur of crime, but duty is duty, and\r\nI have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me. I\r\nshall feel more at ease when we have our story-teller here safe under\r\nlock and key. The cab still waits, and there are two inspectors\r\ndownstairs. I am much obliged to you both for your assistance. Of\r\ncourse you will be wanted at the trial. Good-night to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, gentlemen both,\u201d said Jonathan Small.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou first, Small,\u201d remarked the wary Jones as they left the room.\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take particular care that you don\u2019t club me with your wooden leg,\r\nwhatever you may have done to the gentleman at the Andaman Isles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, and there is the end of our little drama,\u201d I remarked, after we\r\nhad set some time smoking in silence. \u201cI fear that it may be the last\r\ninvestigation in which I shall have the chance of studying your\r\nmethods. Miss Morstan has done me the honour to accept me as a husband\r\nin prospective.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe gave a most dismal groan. \u201cI feared as much,\u201d said he. \u201cI really\r\ncannot congratulate you.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was a little hurt. \u201cHave you any reason to be dissatisfied with my\r\nchoice?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I\r\never met, and might have been most useful in such work as we have been\r\ndoing. She had a decided genius that way: witness the way in which she\r\npreserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father. But\r\nlove is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to\r\nthat true cold reason which I place above all things. I should never\r\nmarry myself, lest I bias my judgment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI trust,\u201d said I, laughing, \u201cthat my judgment may survive the ordeal.\r\nBut you look weary.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the reaction is already upon me. I shall be as limp as a rag for\r\na week.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStrange,\u201d said I, \u201chow terms of what in another man I should call\r\nlaziness alternate with your fits of splendid energy and vigour.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he answered, \u201cthere are in me the makings of a very fine loafer\r\nand also of a pretty spry sort of fellow. I often think of those lines\r\nof old Goethe,\u2014\r\n\r\nSchade dass die Natur nur _einen_ Mensch aus Dir schuf,\r\nDenn zum w\u00fcrdigen Mann war und zum Schelmen der Stoff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way, _\u00e0 propos_ of this Norwood business, you see that they\r\nhad, as I surmised, a confederate in the house, who could be none other\r\nthan Lal Rao, the butler: so Jones actually has the undivided honour of\r\nhaving caught one fish in his great haul.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe division seems rather unfair,\u201d I remarked. \u201cYou have done all the\r\nwork in this business. I get a wife out of it, Jones gets the credit,\r\npray what remains for you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor me,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, \u201cthere still remains the\r\ncocaine-bottle.\u201d And he stretched his long white hand up for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SIGN OF THE FOUR ***\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

I stood upon the\r\n      hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left\r\n      behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood,\r\n      bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a \u201cPenang lawyer.\u201d\r\n      Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch\r\n      across. \u201cTo James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the\r\n      C.C.H.,\u201d was engraved upon it, with the date \u201c1884.\u201d It was just\r\n      such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to\r\n      carry\u2014dignified, solid, and reassuring.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, Watson, what do you make of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no\r\n      sign of my occupation.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in\r\n      the back of your head.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in\r\n      front of me,\u201d said he. \u201cBut, tell me, Watson, what do you make of\r\n      our visitor\u2019s stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss\r\n      him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir\r\n      becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an\r\n      examination of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think,\u201d said I, following as far as I could the methods of my\r\n      companion, \u201cthat Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical\r\n      man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of\r\n      their appreciation.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cExcellent!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think also that the probability is in favour of his being a\r\n      country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on\r\n      foot.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy so?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause this stick, though originally a very handsome one has\r\n      been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town\r\n      practitioner carrying it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so\r\n      it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with\r\n      it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerfectly sound!\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd then again, there is the \u2018friends of the C.C.H.\u2019 I should\r\n      guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose\r\n      members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which\r\n      has made him a small presentation in return.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cReally, Watson, you excel yourself,\u201d said Holmes, pushing back\r\n      his chair and lighting a cigarette. \u201cI am bound to say that in\r\n      all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own\r\n      small achievements you have habitually underrated your own\r\n      abilities. It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you\r\n      are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius\r\n      have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear\r\n      fellow, that I am very much in your debt.\u201d\r\n\r\n      He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words\r\n      gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his\r\n      indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had\r\n      made to give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too, to think\r\n      that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way\r\n      which earned his approval. He now took the stick from my hands\r\n      and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with\r\n      an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and\r\n      carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a\r\n      convex lens.\r\n\r\n      \u201cInteresting, though elementary,\u201d said he as he returned to his\r\n      favourite corner of the settee. \u201cThere are certainly one or two\r\n      indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several\r\n      deductions.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHas anything escaped me?\u201d I asked with some self-importance. \u201cI\r\n      trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have\r\n      overlooked?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were\r\n      erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be\r\n      frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided\r\n      towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this\r\n      instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he\r\n      walks a good deal.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen I was right.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo that extent.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut that was all.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no, my dear Watson, not all\u2014by no means all. I would\r\n      suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more\r\n      likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when\r\n      the initials \u2018C.C.\u2019 are placed before that hospital the words\r\n      \u2018Charing Cross\u2019 very naturally suggest themselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou may be right.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a\r\n      working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our\r\n      construction of this unknown visitor.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, then, supposing that \u2018C.C.H.\u2019 does stand for \u2018Charing\r\n      Cross Hospital,\u2019 what further inferences may we draw?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has\r\n      practised in town before going to the country.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look\r\n      at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable\r\n      that such a presentation would be made? When would his friends\r\n      unite to give him a pledge of their good will? Obviously at the\r\n      moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the\r\n      hospital in order to start a practice for himself. We know there\r\n      has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change from\r\n      a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then, stretching\r\n      our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the\r\n      occasion of the change?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt certainly seems probable.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow, you will observe that he could not have been on the _staff_\r\n      of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London\r\n      practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not\r\n      drift into the country. What was he, then? If he was in the\r\n      hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a\r\n      house-surgeon or a house-physician\u2014little more than a senior\r\n      student. And he left five years ago\u2014the date is on the stick. So\r\n      your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin\r\n      air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under\r\n      thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of\r\n      a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger\r\n      than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his\r\n      settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,\u201d said I,\r\n      \u201cbut at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars\r\n      about the man\u2019s age and professional career.\u201d From my small\r\n      medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the\r\n      name. There were several Mortimers, but only one who could be our\r\n      visitor. I read his record aloud.\r\n\r\n        \u201cMortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.\r\n        House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital.\r\n        Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology, with\r\n        essay entitled \u2018Is Disease a Reversion?\u2019  Corresponding member\r\n        of the Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of \u2018Some Freaks of\r\n        Atavism\u2019 (_Lancet_ 1882).  \u2018Do We Progress?\u2019 (_Journal of\r\n        Psychology_, March, 1883). Medical Officer for the parishes of\r\n        Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo mention of that local hunt, Watson,\u201d said Holmes with a\r\n      mischievous smile, \u201cbut a country doctor, as you very astutely\r\n      observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As\r\n      to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable,\r\n      unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is\r\n      only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only\r\n      an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country,\r\n      and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his\r\n      visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the dog?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHas been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master.\r\n      Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle,\r\n      and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog\u2019s\r\n      jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in\r\n      my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. It\r\n      may have been\u2014yes, by Jove, it _is_ a curly-haired spaniel.\u201d\r\n\r\n      He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the\r\n      recess of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his\r\n      voice that I glanced up in surprise.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cFor the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our\r\n      very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don\u2019t move, I\r\n      beg you, Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your\r\n      presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment\r\n      of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is\r\n      walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill.\r\n      What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock\r\n      Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!\u201d\r\n\r\n      The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had\r\n      expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin\r\n      man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two\r\n      keen, grey eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from\r\n      behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a\r\n      professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was\r\n      dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was\r\n      already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head\r\n      and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes\r\n      fell upon the stick in Holmes\u2019s hand, and he ran towards it with\r\n      an exclamation of joy. \u201cI am so very glad,\u201d said he. \u201cI was not\r\n      sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I\r\n      would not lose that stick for the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cA presentation, I see,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cFrom Charing Cross Hospital?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cFrom one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDear, dear, that\u2019s bad!\u201d said Holmes, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n      Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment.\r\n      \u201cWhy was it bad?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOnly that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your\r\n      marriage, you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all\r\n      hopes of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home\r\n      of my own.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n      \u201cAnd now, Dr. James Mortimer\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMister, sir, Mister\u2014a humble M.R.C.S.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd a man of precise mind, evidently.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cA dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the\r\n      shores of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr.\r\n      Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, this is my friend Dr. Watson.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cGlad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in\r\n      connection with that of your friend. You interest me very much,\r\n      Mr. Holmes. I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or\r\n      such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any\r\n      objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? A\r\n      cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would\r\n      be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my\r\n      intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. \u201cYou are\r\n      an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am\r\n      in mine,\u201d said he. \u201cI observe from your forefinger that you make\r\n      your own cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the\r\n      other with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers\r\n      as agile and restless as the antenn\u00e6 of an insect.\r\n\r\n      Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the\r\n      interest which he took in our curious companion. \u201cI presume,\r\n      sir,\u201d said he at last, \u201cthat it was not merely for the purpose of\r\n      examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here\r\n      last night and again today?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of\r\n      doing that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I\r\n      recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am\r\n      suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary\r\n      problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest\r\n      expert in Europe\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIndeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?\u201d\r\n      asked Holmes with some asperity.\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur\r\n      Bertillon must always appeal strongly.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen had you not better consult him?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a\r\n      practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone.\r\n      I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cJust a little,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI think, Dr. Mortimer, you would\r\n      do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly\r\n      what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my\r\n      assistance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2.\r\nThe Curse of the Baskervilles\r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have in my pocket a manuscript,\u201d said Dr. James Mortimer.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI observed it as you entered the room,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is an old manuscript.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cEarly eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow can you say that, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all\r\n      the time that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert\r\n      who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so.\r\n      You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject.\r\n      I put that at 1730.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe exact date is 1742.\u201d Dr. Mortimer drew it from his\r\n      breast-pocket. \u201cThis family paper was committed to my care by Sir\r\n      Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three\r\n      months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire. I may say\r\n      that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant.\r\n      He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as\r\n      unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document very\r\n      seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did\r\n      eventually overtake him.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it\r\n      upon his knee. \u201cYou will observe, Watson, the alternative use of\r\n      the long _s_ and the short. It is one of several indications\r\n      which enabled me to fix the date.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded\r\n      script. At the head was written: \u201cBaskerville Hall,\u201d and below in\r\n      large, scrawling figures: \u201c1742.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt appears to be a statement of some sort.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the\r\n      Baskerville family.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut I understand that it is something more modern and practical\r\n      upon which you wish to consult me?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMost modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be\r\n      decided within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and\r\n      is intimately connected with the affair. With your permission I\r\n      will read it to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together,\r\n      and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer\r\n      turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking\r\n      voice the following curious, old-world narrative:\r\n\r\n        \u201cOf the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been\r\n        many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo\r\n        Baskerville, and as I had the story from my father, who also\r\n        had it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it\r\n        occurred even as is here set forth. And I would have you\r\n        believe, my sons, that the same Justice which punishes sin may\r\n        also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy\r\n        but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed.  Learn\r\n        then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but\r\n        rather to be circumspect in the future, that those foul\r\n        passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not\r\n        again be loosed to our undoing.\r\n\r\n            \u201cKnow then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the\r\n            history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most\r\n            earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of\r\n            Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be\r\n            gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless man.\r\n             This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned, seeing\r\n            that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there\r\n            was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his\r\n            name a by-word through the West.  It chanced that this Hugo\r\n            came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known\r\n            under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held\r\n            lands near the Baskerville estate. But the young maiden,\r\n            being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him,\r\n            for she feared his evil name.  So it came to pass that one\r\n            Michaelmas this Hugo, with five or six of his idle and\r\n            wicked companions, stole down upon the farm and carried off\r\n            the maiden, her father and brothers being from home, as he\r\n            well knew.  When they had brought her to the Hall the\r\n            maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his\r\n            friends sat down to a long carouse, as was their nightly\r\n            custom.  Now, the poor lass upstairs was like to have her\r\n            wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths\r\n            which came up to her from below, for they say that the\r\n            words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were\r\n            such as might blast the man who said them.  At last in the\r\n            stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted\r\n            the bravest or most active man, for by the aid of the\r\n            growth of ivy which covered (and still covers) the south\r\n            wall she came down from under the eaves, and so homeward\r\n            across the moor, there being three leagues betwixt the Hall\r\n            and her father\u2019s farm.\r\n\r\n            \u201cIt chanced that some little time later Hugo left his\r\n            guests to carry food and drink\u2014with other worse things,\r\n            perchance\u2014to his captive, and so found the cage empty and\r\n            the bird escaped.  Then, as it would seem, he became as one\r\n            that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the\r\n            dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table, flagons and\r\n            trenchers flying before him, and he cried aloud before all\r\n            the company that he would that very night render his body\r\n            and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the\r\n            wench.  And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of\r\n            the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than\r\n            the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon\r\n            her.  Whereat Hugo ran from the house, crying to his grooms\r\n            that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and\r\n            giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid\u2019s, he swung them\r\n            to the line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the\r\n            moor.\r\n\r\n            \u201cNow, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable to\r\n            understand all that had been done in such haste.  But anon\r\n            their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which\r\n            was like to be done upon the moorlands.  Everything was now\r\n            in an uproar, some calling for their pistols, some for\r\n            their horses, and some for another flask of wine.  But at\r\n            length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and the\r\n            whole of them, thirteen in number, took horse and started\r\n            in pursuit.  The moon shone clear above them, and they rode\r\n            swiftly abreast, taking that course which the maid must\r\n            needs have taken if she were to reach her own home.\r\n\r\n            \u201cThey had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the\r\n            night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him\r\n            to know if he had seen the hunt.  And the man, as the story\r\n            goes, was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak,\r\n            but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy\r\n            maiden, with the hounds upon her track.  \u2018But I have seen\r\n            more than that,\u2019 said he, \u2018for Hugo Baskerville passed me\r\n            upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind him such a\r\n            hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels.\u2019 \r\n            So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward.\r\n             But soon their skins turned cold, for there came a\r\n            galloping across the moor, and the black mare, dabbled with\r\n            white froth, went past with trailing bridle and empty\r\n            saddle.  Then the revellers rode close together, for a\r\n            great fear was on them, but they still followed over the\r\n            moor, though each, had he been alone, would have been right\r\n            glad to have turned his horse\u2019s head.  Riding slowly in\r\n            this fashion they came at last upon the hounds.  These,\r\n            though known for their valour and their breed, were\r\n            whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal,\r\n            as we call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and some,\r\n            with starting hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the\r\n            narrow valley before them.\r\n\r\n            \u201cThe company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may\r\n            guess, than when they started.  The most of them would by\r\n            no means advance, but three of them, the boldest, or it may\r\n            be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal. Now, it\r\n            opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great\r\n            stones, still to be seen there, which were set by certain\r\n            forgotten peoples in the days of old. The moon was shining\r\n            bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre lay the\r\n            unhappy maid where she had fallen, dead of fear and of\r\n            fatigue.  But it was not the sight of her body, nor yet was\r\n            it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville lying near her,\r\n            which raised the hair upon the heads of these three\r\n            dare-devil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo,\r\n            and plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a\r\n            great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than\r\n            any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon.  And even\r\n            as they looked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo\r\n            Baskerville, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and\r\n            dripping jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and\r\n            rode for dear life, still screaming, across the moor.  One,\r\n            it is said, died that very night of what he had seen, and\r\n            the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their\r\n            days.\r\n\r\n            \u201cSuch is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound\r\n            which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever\r\n            since.  If I have set it down it is because that which is\r\n            clearly known hath less terror than that which is but\r\n            hinted at and guessed.  Nor can it be denied that many of\r\n            the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have\r\n            been sudden, bloody, and mysterious.  Yet may we shelter\r\n            ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence, which\r\n            would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or\r\n            fourth generation which is threatened in Holy Writ.  To\r\n            that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I\r\n            counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the\r\n            moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are\r\n            exalted.\r\n\r\n            \u201c[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John,\r\n            with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their\r\n            sister Elizabeth.]\u201d\r\n\r\n      When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he\r\n      pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr.\r\n      Sherlock Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his\r\n      cigarette into the fire.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell?\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you not find it interesting?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo a collector of fairy tales.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more\r\n      recent. This is the _Devon County Chronicle_ of May 14th of this\r\n      year. It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of\r\n      Sir Charles Baskerville which occurred a few days before that\r\n      date.\u201d\r\n\r\n      My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became\r\n      intent. Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:\r\n\r\n        \u201cThe recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name\r\n        has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for\r\n        Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over the\r\n        county.  Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for\r\n        a comparatively short period his amiability of character and\r\n        extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who\r\n        had been brought into contact with him.  In these days of\r\n        _nouveaux riches_ it is refreshing to find a case where the\r\n        scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days\r\n        is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him\r\n        to restore the fallen grandeur of his line.  Sir Charles, as is\r\n        well known, made large sums of money in South African\r\n        speculation. More wise than those who go on until the wheel\r\n        turns against them, he realised his gains and returned to\r\n        England with them.  It is only two years since he took up his\r\n        residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how large\r\n        were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have\r\n        been interrupted by his death.  Being himself childless, it was\r\n        his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should,\r\n        within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many\r\n        will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end.  His\r\n        generous donations to local and county charities have been\r\n        frequently chronicled in these columns.\r\n\r\n            \u201cThe circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles\r\n            cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the\r\n            inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of\r\n            those rumours to which local superstition has given rise.\r\n            There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to\r\n            imagine that death could be from any but natural causes.\r\n            Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to\r\n            have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In\r\n            spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his\r\n            personal tastes, and his indoor servants at Baskerville\r\n            Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the\r\n            husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper. Their\r\n            evidence, corroborated by that of several friends, tends to\r\n            show that Sir Charles\u2019s health has for some time been\r\n            impaired, and points especially to some affection of the\r\n            heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour,\r\n            breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression.\r\n            Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of the\r\n            deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.\r\n\r\n            \u201cThe facts of the case are simple.  Sir Charles Baskerville\r\n            was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking\r\n            down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall.  The\r\n            evidence of the Barrymores shows that this had been his\r\n            custom. On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his\r\n            intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered\r\n            Barrymore to prepare his luggage.  That night he went out\r\n            as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he\r\n            was in the habit of smoking a cigar.  He never returned. \r\n            At twelve o\u2019clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still\r\n            open, became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in\r\n            search of his master.  The day had been wet, and Sir\r\n            Charles\u2019s footmarks were easily traced down the alley. \r\n            Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on\r\n            to the moor. There were indications that Sir Charles had\r\n            stood for some little time here.  He then proceeded down\r\n            the alley, and it was at the far end of it that his body\r\n            was discovered. One fact which has not been explained is\r\n            the statement of Barrymore that his master\u2019s footprints\r\n            altered their character from the time that he passed the\r\n            moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have\r\n            been walking upon his toes.  One Murphy, a gipsy\r\n            horse-dealer, was on the moor at no great distance at the\r\n            time, but he appears by his own confession to have been the\r\n            worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries but is\r\n            unable to state from what direction they came.  No signs of\r\n            violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles\u2019s person,\r\n            and though the doctor\u2019s evidence pointed to an almost\r\n            incredible facial distortion\u2014so great that Dr. Mortimer\r\n            refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend\r\n            and patient who lay before him\u2014it was explained that that\r\n            is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspn\u0153a and\r\n            death from cardiac exhaustion.  This explanation was borne\r\n            out by the post-mortem examination, which showed\r\n            long-standing organic disease, and the coroner\u2019s jury\r\n            returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence.\r\n             It is well that this is so, for it is obviously of the\r\n            utmost importance that Sir Charles\u2019s heir should settle at\r\n            the Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly\r\n            interrupted.  Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not\r\n            finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been\r\n            whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been\r\n            difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall.  It is\r\n            understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville,\r\n            if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville\u2019s\r\n            younger brother.  The young man when last heard of was in\r\n            America, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to\r\n            informing him of his good fortune.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Dr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket.\r\n      \u201cThose are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the\r\n      death of Sir Charles Baskerville.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI must thank you,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, \u201cfor calling my\r\n      attention to a case which certainly presents some features of\r\n      interest. I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but\r\n      I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the\r\n      Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch\r\n      with several interesting English cases. This article, you say,\r\n      contains all the public facts?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt does.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen let me have the private ones.\u201d He leaned back, put his\r\n      finger-tips together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial\r\n      expression.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn doing so,\u201d said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of\r\n      some strong emotion, \u201cI am telling that which I have not confided\r\n      to anyone. My motive for withholding it from the coroner\u2019s\r\n      inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in\r\n      the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition.\r\n      I had the further motive that Baskerville Hall, as the paper\r\n      says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to\r\n      increase its already rather grim reputation. For both these\r\n      reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less\r\n      than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but\r\n      with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near\r\n      each other are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a\r\n      good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr.\r\n      Frankland, of Lafter Hall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist,\r\n      there are no other men of education within many miles. Sir\r\n      Charles was a retiring man, but the chance of his illness brought\r\n      us together, and a community of interests in science kept us so.\r\n      He had brought back much scientific information from South\r\n      Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together\r\n      discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the\r\n      Hottentot.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWithin the last few months it became increasingly plain to me\r\n      that Sir Charles\u2019s nervous system was strained to the breaking\r\n      point. He had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly\r\n      to heart\u2014so much so that, although he would walk in his own\r\n      grounds, nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at\r\n      night. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was\r\n      honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and\r\n      certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors\r\n      were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence\r\n      constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has\r\n      asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen\r\n      any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter\r\n      question he put to me several times, and always with a voice\r\n      which vibrated with excitement.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some\r\n      three weeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall\r\n      door. I had descended from my gig and was standing in front of\r\n      him, when I saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and\r\n      stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror. I\r\n      whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something\r\n      which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the\r\n      drive. So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go\r\n      down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for\r\n      it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the\r\n      worst impression upon his mind. I stayed with him all the\r\n      evening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion\r\n      which he had shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative\r\n      which I read to you when first I came. I mention this small\r\n      episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy\r\n      which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the matter\r\n      was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no\r\n      justification.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London.\r\n      His heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in\r\n      which he lived, however chimerical the cause of it might be, was\r\n      evidently having a serious effect upon his health. I thought that\r\n      a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a\r\n      new man. Mr. Stapleton, a mutual friend who was much concerned at\r\n      his state of health, was of the same opinion. At the last instant\r\n      came this terrible catastrophe.\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn the night of Sir Charles\u2019s death Barrymore the butler, who\r\n      made the discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me,\r\n      and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall\r\n      within an hour of the event. I checked and corroborated all the\r\n      facts which were mentioned at the inquest. I followed the\r\n      footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at the moor-gate\r\n      where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the\r\n      shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no\r\n      other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and\r\n      finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched\r\n      until my arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his\r\n      fingers dug into the ground, and his features convulsed with some\r\n      strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have sworn\r\n      to his identity. There was certainly no physical injury of any\r\n      kind. But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the\r\n      inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the ground round\r\n      the body. He did not observe any. But I did\u2014some little distance\r\n      off, but fresh and clear.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cFootprints?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cFootprints.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cA man\u2019s or a woman\u2019s?\u201d\r\n\r\n      Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice\r\n      sank almost to a whisper as he answered.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3.\r\nThe Problem\r\n\r\n\r\n      I confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a\r\n      thrill in the doctor\u2019s voice which showed that he was himself\r\n      deeply moved by that which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in\r\n      his excitement and his eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot\r\n      from them when he was keenly interested.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou saw this?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs clearly as I see you.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you said nothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat was the use?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow was it that no one else saw it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave\r\n      them a thought. I don\u2019t suppose I should have done so had I not\r\n      known this legend.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are many sheep-dogs on the moor?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou say it was large?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cEnormous.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut it had not approached the body?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat sort of night was it?\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cDamp and raw.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut not actually raining?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is the alley like?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and\r\n      impenetrable. The walk in the centre is about eight feet across.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs there anything between the hedges and the walk?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either\r\n      side.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a\r\n      gate?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs there any other opening?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it\r\n      from the house or else to enter it by the moor-gate?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is an exit through a summer-house at the far end.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHad Sir Charles reached this?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo; he lay about fifty yards from it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow, tell me, Dr. Mortimer\u2014and this is important\u2014the marks which\r\n      you saw were on the path and not on the grass?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo marks could show on the grass.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWere they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the\r\n      moor-gate.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate\r\n      closed?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cClosed and padlocked.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow high was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAbout four feet high.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen anyone could have got over it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNone in particular.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood heaven! Did no one examine?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, I examined, myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd found nothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there\r\n      for five or ten minutes.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause the ash had twice dropped from his cigar.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExcellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But\r\n      the marks?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I\r\n      could discern no others.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an\r\n      impatient gesture.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf I had only been there!\u201d he cried. \u201cIt is evidently a case of\r\n      extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense\r\n      opportunities to the scientific expert. That gravel page upon\r\n      which I might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by\r\n      the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants. Oh, Dr.\r\n      Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you should not have called\r\n      me in! You have indeed much to answer for.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these\r\n      facts to the world, and I have already given my reasons for not\r\n      wishing to do so. Besides, besides\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy do you hesitate?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of\r\n      detectives is helpless.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou mean that the thing is supernatural?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI did not positively say so.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, but you evidently think it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSince the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears\r\n      several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled\r\n      order of Nature.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cFor example?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI find that before the terrible event occurred several people\r\n      had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this\r\n      Baskerville demon, and which could not possibly be any animal\r\n      known to science. They all agreed that it was a huge creature,\r\n      luminous, ghastly, and spectral. I have cross-examined these men,\r\n      one of them a hard-headed countryman, one a farrier, and one a\r\n      moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this dreadful\r\n      apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the\r\n      legend. I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the\r\n      district, and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at\r\n      night.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you, a trained man of science, believe it to be\r\n      supernatural?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI do not know what to believe.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI have hitherto confined my\r\n      investigations to this world,\u201d said he. \u201cIn a modest way I have\r\n      combated evil, but to take on the Father of Evil himself would,\r\n      perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must admit that the\r\n      footmark is material.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe original hound was material enough to tug a man\u2019s throat\r\n      out, and yet he was diabolical as well.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But\r\n      now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why\r\n      have you come to consult me at all? You tell me in the same\r\n      breath that it is useless to investigate Sir Charles\u2019s death, and\r\n      that you desire me to do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI did not say that I desired you to do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen, how can I assist you?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBy advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry\r\n      Baskerville, who arrives at Waterloo Station\u201d\u2014Dr. Mortimer looked\r\n      at his watch\u2014\u201cin exactly one hour and a quarter.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe being the heir?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young\r\n      gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada. From the\r\n      accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every\r\n      way. I speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and\r\n      executor of Sir Charles\u2019s will.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is no other claimant, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNone. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was\r\n      Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor\r\n      Sir Charles was the elder. The second brother, who died young, is\r\n      the father of this lad Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black\r\n      sheep of the family. He came of the old masterful Baskerville\r\n      strain and was the very image, they tell me, of the family\r\n      picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to hold him, fled to\r\n      Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is\r\n      the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five minutes I meet\r\n      him at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he arrived at\r\n      Southampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise\r\n      me to do with him?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy should he not go to the home of his fathers?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every\r\n      Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure\r\n      that if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he\r\n      would have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old\r\n      race, and the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet\r\n      it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak\r\n      countryside depends upon his presence. All the good work which\r\n      has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is\r\n      no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by\r\n      my own obvious interest in the matter, and that is why I bring\r\n      the case before you and ask for your advice.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes considered for a little time.\r\n\r\n      \u201cPut into plain words, the matter is this,\u201d said he. \u201cIn your\r\n      opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an\r\n      unsafe abode for a Baskerville\u2014that is your opinion?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt least I might go the length of saying that there is some\r\n      evidence that this may be so.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it\r\n      could work the young man evil in London as easily as in\r\n      Devonshire. A devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry\r\n      would be too inconceivable a thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would\r\n      probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these\r\n      things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young\r\n      man will be as safe in Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty\r\n      minutes. What would you recommend?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who\r\n      is scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet\r\n      Sir Henry Baskerville.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd then?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up\r\n      my mind about the matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow long will it take you to make up your mind?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cTwenty-four hours. At ten o\u2019clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will\r\n      be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will\r\n      be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir\r\n      Henry Baskerville with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will do so, Mr. Holmes.\u201d He scribbled the appointment on his\r\n      shirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded\r\n      fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.\r\n\r\n      \u201cOnly one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir\r\n      Charles Baskerville\u2019s death several people saw this apparition\r\n      upon the moor?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThree people did.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid any see it after?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have not heard of any.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThank you. Good-morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward\r\n      satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.\r\n\r\n      \u201cGoing out, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cUnless I can help you.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to\r\n      you for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points\r\n      of view. When you pass Bradley\u2019s, would you ask him to send up a\r\n      pound of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as\r\n      well if you could make it convenient not to return before\r\n      evening. Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to\r\n      this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this\r\n      morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my\r\n      friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during\r\n      which he weighed every particle of evidence, constructed\r\n      alternative theories, balanced one against the other, and made up\r\n      his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial.\r\n      I therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to Baker\r\n      Street until evening. It was nearly nine o\u2019clock when I found\r\n      myself in the sitting-room once more.\r\n\r\n      My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had\r\n      broken out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light\r\n      of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered,\r\n      however, my fears were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of\r\n      strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me\r\n      coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision of Holmes in his\r\n      dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe\r\n      between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him.\r\n\r\n      \u201cCaught cold, Watson?\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, it\u2019s this poisonous atmosphere.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI suppose it _is_ pretty thick, now that you mention it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThick! It is intolerable.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOpen the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I\r\n      perceive.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAm I right?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cCertainly, but how?\u201d\r\n\r\n      He laughed at my bewildered expression. \u201cThere is a delightful\r\n      freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to\r\n      exercise any small powers which I possess at your expense. A\r\n      gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns\r\n      immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his\r\n      boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a man\r\n      with intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not\r\n      obvious?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, it is rather obvious.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance\r\n      ever observes. Where do you think that I have been?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cA fixture also.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn the contrary, I have been to Devonshire.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn spirit?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly. My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret\r\n      to observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and\r\n      an incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to\r\n      Stamford\u2019s for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and\r\n      my spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I\r\n      could find my way about.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cA large-scale map, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery large.\u201d\r\n\r\n      He unrolled one section and held it over his knee. \u201cHere you have\r\n      the particular district which concerns us. That is Baskerville\r\n      Hall in the middle.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWith a wood round it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that\r\n      name, must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you\r\n      perceive, upon the right of it. This small clump of buildings\r\n      here is the hamlet of Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has\r\n      his headquarters. Within a radius of five miles there are, as you\r\n      see, only a very few scattered dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall,\r\n      which was mentioned in the narrative. There is a house indicated\r\n      here which may be the residence of the naturalist\u2014Stapleton, if I\r\n      remember right, was his name. Here are two moorland farmhouses,\r\n      High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the great convict\r\n      prison of Princetown. Between and around these scattered points\r\n      extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is the stage\r\n      upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to\r\n      play it again.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt must be a wild place.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to\r\n      have a hand in the affairs of men\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you are yourself inclining to the supernatural\r\n      explanation.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe devil\u2019s agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?\r\n      There are two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is\r\n      whether any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what\r\n      is the crime and how was it committed? Of course, if Dr.\r\n      Mortimer\u2019s surmise should be correct, and we are dealing with\r\n      forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature, there is an end of\r\n      our investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all other\r\n      hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I think we\u2019ll shut\r\n      that window again, if you don\u2019t mind. It is a singular thing, but\r\n      I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of\r\n      thought. I have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box\r\n      to think, but that is the logical outcome of my convictions. Have\r\n      you turned the case over in your mind?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you make of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is very bewildering.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt has certainly a character of its own. There are points of\r\n      distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example.\r\n      What do you make of that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that\r\n      portion of the alley.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why\r\n      should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat then?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe was running, Watson\u2014running desperately, running for his\r\n      life, running until he burst his heart\u2014and fell dead upon his\r\n      face.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cRunning from what?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere lies our problem. There are indications that the man was\r\n      crazed with fear before ever he began to run.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow can you say that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across\r\n      the moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man\r\n      who had lost his wits would have run _from_ the house instead of\r\n      towards it. If the gipsy\u2019s evidence may be taken as true, he ran\r\n      with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely\r\n      to be. Then, again, whom was he waiting for that night, and why\r\n      was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own\r\n      house?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou think that he was waiting for someone?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an\r\n      evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement.\r\n      Is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as\r\n      Dr. Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have given\r\n      him credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut he went out every evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every\r\n      evening. On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the\r\n      moor. That night he waited there. It was the night before he made\r\n      his departure for London. The thing takes shape, Watson. It\r\n      becomes coherent. Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and we\r\n      will postpone all further thought upon this business until we\r\n      have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry\r\n      Baskerville in the morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4.\r\nSir Henry Baskerville\r\n\r\n\r\n      Our breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his\r\n      dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were\r\n      punctual to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten\r\n      when Dr. Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet.\r\n      The latter was a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years\r\n      of age, very sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a\r\n      strong, pugnacious face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and\r\n      had the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of\r\n      his time in the open air, and yet there was something in his\r\n      steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated\r\n      the gentleman.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis is Sir Henry Baskerville,\u201d said Dr. Mortimer.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, yes,\u201d said he, \u201cand the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock\r\n      Holmes, that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to\r\n      you this morning I should have come on my own account. I\r\n      understand that you think out little puzzles, and I\u2019ve had one\r\n      this morning which wants more thinking out than I am able to give\r\n      it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cPray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you\r\n      have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in\r\n      London?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as\r\n      not. It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which\r\n      reached me this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n      He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It\r\n      was of common quality, greyish in colour. The address, \u201cSir Henry\r\n      Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel,\u201d was printed in rough\r\n      characters; the post-mark \u201cCharing Cross,\u201d and the date of\r\n      posting the preceding evening.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?\u201d asked\r\n      Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr.\r\n      Mortimer.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, I had been staying with a friend,\u201d said the doctor.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere was no possible indication that we intended to go to this\r\n      hotel.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your\r\n      movements.\u201d Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap\r\n      paper folded into four. This he opened and spread flat upon the\r\n      table. Across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed\r\n      by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it. It ran:\r\n\r\n        As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.\r\n\r\n      The word \u201cmoor\u201d only was printed in ink.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow,\u201d said Sir Henry Baskerville, \u201cperhaps you will tell me, Mr.\r\n      Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is\r\n      that takes so much interest in my affairs?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there\r\n      is nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was\r\n      convinced that the business is supernatural.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat business?\u201d asked Sir Henry sharply. \u201cIt seems to me that\r\n      all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own\r\n      affairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir\r\n      Henry. I promise you that,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cWe will\r\n      confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this\r\n      very interesting document, which must have been put together and\r\n      posted yesterday evening. Have you yesterday\u2019s _Times_, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is here in the corner.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMight I trouble you for it\u2014the inside page, please, with the\r\n      leading articles?\u201d He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes\r\n      up and down the columns. \u201cCapital article this on free trade.\r\n      Permit me to give you an extract from it.\r\n\r\n     \u2018You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or\r\n     your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but\r\n     it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run\r\n     keep away wealth from the country, diminish the value of our\r\n     imports, and lower the general conditions of life in this island.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you think of that, Watson?\u201d cried Holmes in high glee,\r\n      rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. \u201cDon\u2019t you think\r\n      that is an admirable sentiment?\u201d\r\n\r\n      Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional\r\n      interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark\r\n      eyes upon me.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know much about the tariff and things of that kind,\u201d\r\n      said he, \u201cbut it seems to me we\u2019ve got a bit off the trail so far\r\n      as that note is concerned.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail,\r\n      Sir Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do,\r\n      but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of\r\n      this sentence.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, I confess that I see no connection.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection\r\n      that the one is extracted out of the other. \u2018You,\u2019 \u2018your,\u2019\r\n      \u2018your,\u2019 \u2018life,\u2019 \u2018reason,\u2019 \u2018value,\u2019 \u2018keep away,\u2019 \u2018from the.\u2019 Don\u2019t\r\n      you see now whence these words have been taken?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBy thunder, you\u2019re right! Well, if that isn\u2019t smart!\u201d cried Sir\r\n      Henry.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that\r\n      \u2018keep away\u2019 and \u2018from the\u2019 are cut out in one piece.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, now\u2014so it is!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cReally, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have\r\n      imagined,\u201d said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement.\r\n      \u201cI could understand anyone saying that the words were from a\r\n      newspaper; but that you should name which, and add that it came\r\n      from the leading article, is really one of the most remarkable\r\n      things which I have ever known. How did you do it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from\r\n      that of an Esquimau?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMost certainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut how?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious.\r\n      The supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve,\r\n      the\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally\r\n      obvious. There is as much difference to my eyes between the\r\n      leaded bourgeois type of a _Times_ article and the slovenly print\r\n      of an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your\r\n      negro and your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of the\r\n      most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in\r\n      crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I\r\n      confused the _Leeds Mercury_ with the _Western Morning News_. But\r\n      a _Times_ leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could\r\n      have been taken from nothing else. As it was done yesterday the\r\n      strong probability was that we should find the words in\r\n      yesterday\u2019s issue.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said Sir Henry\r\n      Baskerville, \u201csomeone cut out this message with a scissors\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNail-scissors,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYou can see that it was a very\r\n      short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips\r\n      over \u2018keep away.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of\r\n      short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cGum,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWith gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word \u2018moor\u2019\r\n      should have been written?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause he could not find it in print. The other words were all\r\n      simple and might be found in any issue, but \u2018moor\u2019 would be less\r\n      common.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything\r\n      else in this message, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have\r\n      been taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is\r\n      printed in rough characters. But the _Times_ is a paper which is\r\n      seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated. We\r\n      may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an\r\n      educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his\r\n      effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing\r\n      might be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you will\r\n      observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but\r\n      that some are much higher than others. \u2018Life,\u2019 for example is\r\n      quite out of its proper place. That may point to carelessness or\r\n      it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter.\r\n      On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter was\r\n      evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of such\r\n      a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up the\r\n      interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any\r\n      letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he\r\n      would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption\u2014and\r\n      from whom?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,\u201d said Dr.\r\n      Mortimer.\r\n\r\n      \u201cSay, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and\r\n      choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the\r\n      imagination, but we have always some material basis on which to\r\n      start our speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt,\r\n      but I am almost certain that this address has been written in a\r\n      hotel.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow in the world can you say that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and\r\n      the ink have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered\r\n      twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short\r\n      address, showing that there was very little ink in the bottle.\r\n      Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such\r\n      a state, and the combination of the two must be quite rare. But\r\n      you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get\r\n      anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying that\r\n      could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels around\r\n      Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated _Times_\r\n      leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent\r\n      this singular message. Halloa! Halloa! What\u2019s this?\u201d\r\n\r\n      He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words\r\n      were pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing,\u201d said he, throwing it down. \u201cIt is a blank half-sheet\r\n      of paper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have\r\n      drawn as much as we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir\r\n      Henry, has anything else of interest happened to you since you\r\n      have been in London?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have not observed anyone follow or watch you?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,\u201d\r\n      said our visitor. \u201cWhy in thunder should anyone follow or watch\r\n      me?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to us\r\n      before we go into this matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth\r\n      reporting.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Sir Henry smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t know much of British life yet, for I\r\n      have spent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada. But I\r\n      hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary\r\n      routine of life over here.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have lost one of your boots?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy dear sir,\u201d cried Dr. Mortimer, \u201cit is only mislaid. You will\r\n      find it when you return to the hotel. What is the use of\r\n      troubling Mr. Holmes with trifles of this kind?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly,\u201d said Holmes, \u201chowever foolish the incident may seem.\r\n      You have lost one of your boots, you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last\r\n      night, and there was only one in the morning. I could get no\r\n      sense out of the chap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I\r\n      only bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have never\r\n      had them on.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be\r\n      cleaned?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I\r\n      put them out.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you\r\n      went out at once and bought a pair of boots?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with\r\n      me. You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the\r\n      part, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways\r\n      out West. Among other things I bought these brown boots\u2014gave six\r\n      dollars for them\u2014and had one stolen before ever I had them on my\r\n      feet.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt seems a singularly useless thing to steal,\u201d said Sherlock\r\n      Holmes. \u201cI confess that I share Dr. Mortimer\u2019s belief that it\r\n      will not be long before the missing boot is found.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd, now, gentlemen,\u201d said the baronet with decision, \u201cit seems\r\n      to me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I\r\n      know. It is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full\r\n      account of what we are all driving at.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYour request is a very reasonable one,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cDr.\r\n      Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your story\r\n      as you told it to us.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his\r\n      pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the\r\n      morning before. Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest\r\n      attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,\u201d\r\n      said he when the long narrative was finished. \u201cOf course, I\u2019ve\r\n      heard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery. It\u2019s the pet\r\n      story of the family, though I never thought of taking it\r\n      seriously before. But as to my uncle\u2019s death\u2014well, it all seems\r\n      boiling up in my head, and I can\u2019t get it clear yet. You don\u2019t\r\n      seem quite to have made up your mind whether it\u2019s a case for a\r\n      policeman or a clergyman.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cPrecisely.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd now there\u2019s this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I\r\n      suppose that fits into its place.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what\r\n      goes on upon the moor,\u201d said Dr. Mortimer.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd also,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat someone is not ill-disposed\r\n      towards you, since they warn you of danger.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOr it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me\r\n      away.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted\r\n      to you, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which\r\n      presents several interesting alternatives. But the practical\r\n      point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or\r\n      is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy should I not go?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere seems to be danger.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger\r\n      from human beings?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, that is what we have to find out.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell,\r\n      Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me\r\n      from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to\r\n      be my final answer.\u201d His dark brows knitted and his face flushed\r\n      to a dusky red as he spoke. It was evident that the fiery temper\r\n      of the Baskervilles was not extinct in this their last\r\n      representative. \u201cMeanwhile,\u201d said he, \u201cI have hardly had time to\r\n      think over all that you have told me. It\u2019s a big thing for a man\r\n      to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I should like\r\n      to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look\r\n      here, Mr. Holmes, it\u2019s half-past eleven now and I am going back\r\n      right away to my hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson,\r\n      come round and lunch with us at two. I\u2019ll be able to tell you\r\n      more clearly then how this thing strikes me.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs that convenient to you, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerfectly.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019d prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ll join you in a walk, with pleasure,\u201d said his companion.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen we meet again at two o\u2019clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!\u201d\r\n\r\n      We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang\r\n      of the front door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the\r\n      languid dreamer to the man of action.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYour hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!\u201d He\r\n      rushed into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a\r\n      few seconds in a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs\r\n      and into the street. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still\r\n      visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of\r\n      Oxford Street.\r\n\r\n      \u201cShall I run on and stop them?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with\r\n      your company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, for\r\n      it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk.\u201d\r\n\r\n      He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which\r\n      divided us by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards\r\n      behind, we followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street.\r\n      Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window, upon\r\n      which Holmes did the same. An instant afterwards he gave a little\r\n      cry of satisfaction, and, following the direction of his eager\r\n      eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted\r\n      on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward\r\n      again.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere\u2019s our man, Watson! Come along! We\u2019ll have a good look at\r\n      him, if we can do no more.\u201d\r\n\r\n      At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of\r\n      piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.\r\n      Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed\r\n      to the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street.\r\n      Holmes looked eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in\r\n      sight. Then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the\r\n      traffic, but the start was too great, and already the cab was out\r\n      of sight.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere now!\u201d said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white\r\n      with vexation from the tide of vehicles. \u201cWas ever such bad luck\r\n      and such bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an\r\n      honest man you will record this also and set it against my\r\n      successes!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho was the man?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have not an idea.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cA spy?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville\r\n      has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in\r\n      town. How else could it be known so quickly that it was the\r\n      Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen? If they had followed\r\n      him the first day I argued that they would follow him also the\r\n      second. You may have observed that I twice strolled over to the\r\n      window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, I remember.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none.\r\n      We are dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very\r\n      deep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is\r\n      a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I\r\n      am conscious always of power and design. When our friends left I\r\n      at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their\r\n      invisible attendant. So wily was he that he had not trusted\r\n      himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab so that he\r\n      could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice.\r\n      His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take\r\n      a cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one\r\n      obvious disadvantage.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt puts him in the power of the cabman.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat a pity we did not get the number!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not\r\n      seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number? No. 2704 is\r\n      our man. But that is no use to us for the moment.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI fail to see how you could have done more.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked\r\n      in the other direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a\r\n      second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance, or,\r\n      better still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited\r\n      there. When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should\r\n      have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and\r\n      seeing where he made for. As it is, by an indiscreet eagerness,\r\n      which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and\r\n      energy by our opponent, we have betrayed ourselves and lost our\r\n      man.\u201d\r\n\r\n      We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this\r\n      conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long\r\n      vanished in front of us.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is no object in our following them,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThe\r\n      shadow has departed and will not return. We must see what further\r\n      cards we have in our hands and play them with decision. Could you\r\n      swear to that man\u2019s face within the cab?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI could swear only to the beard.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd so could I\u2014from which I gather that in all probability it\r\n      was a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no\r\n      use for a beard save to conceal his features. Come in here,\r\n      Watson!\u201d\r\n\r\n      He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he\r\n      was warmly greeted by the manager.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in\r\n      which I had the good fortune to help you?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps\r\n      my life.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection,\r\n      Wilson, that you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who\r\n      showed some ability during the investigation.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir, he is still with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cCould you ring him up?\u2014thank you! And I should be glad to have\r\n      change of this five-pound note.\u201d\r\n\r\n      A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the\r\n      summons of the manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence\r\n      at the famous detective.\r\n\r\n      \u201cLet me have the Hotel Directory,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThank you! Now,\r\n      Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all\r\n      in the immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou will visit each of these in turn.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one\r\n      shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of\r\n      yesterday. You will say that an important telegram has miscarried\r\n      and that you are looking for it. You understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut what you are really looking for is the centre page of the\r\n      _Times_ with some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy\r\n      of the _Times_. It is this page. You could easily recognize it,\r\n      could you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter,\r\n      to whom also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three\r\n      shillings. You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of\r\n      the twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burned\r\n      or removed. In the three other cases you will be shown a heap of\r\n      paper and you will look for this page of the _Times_ among it.\r\n      The odds are enormously against your finding it. There are ten\r\n      shillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a report by\r\n      wire at Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only\r\n      remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman,\r\n      No. 2704, and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street\r\n      picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the\r\n      hotel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5.\r\nThree Broken Threads\r\n\r\n\r\n      Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of\r\n      detaching his mind at will. For two hours the strange business in\r\n      which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was\r\n      entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern Belgian masters.\r\n      He would talk of nothing but art, of which he had the crudest\r\n      ideas, from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at\r\n      the Northumberland Hotel.\r\n\r\n      \u201cSir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,\u201d said the\r\n      clerk. \u201cHe asked me to show you up at once when you came.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you any objection to my looking at your register?\u201d said\r\n      Holmes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot in the least.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The book showed that two names had been added after that of\r\n      Baskerville. One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle;\r\n      the other Mrs. Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.\r\n\r\n      \u201cSurely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know,\u201d said\r\n      Holmes to the porter. \u201cA lawyer, is he not, grey-headed, and\r\n      walks with a limp?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active\r\n      gentleman, not older than yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSurely you are mistaken about his trade?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very\r\n      well known to us.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the\r\n      name. Excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend\r\n      one finds another.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of\r\n      Gloucester. She always comes to us when she is in town.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have\r\n      established a most important fact by these questions, Watson,\u201d he\r\n      continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. \u201cWe know\r\n      now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not\r\n      settled down in his own hotel. That means that while they are, as\r\n      we have seen, very anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious\r\n      that he should not see them. Now, this is a most suggestive\r\n      fact.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat does it suggest?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt suggests\u2014halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the\r\n      matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n      As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir\r\n      Henry Baskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, and\r\n      he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was\r\n      he that he was hardly articulate, and when he did speak it was in\r\n      a much broader and more Western dialect than any which we had\r\n      heard from him in the morning.\r\n\r\n      \u201cSeems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel,\u201d he\r\n      cried. \u201cThey\u2019ll find they\u2019ve started in to monkey with the wrong\r\n      man unless they are careful. By thunder, if that chap can\u2019t find\r\n      my missing boot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with the\r\n      best, Mr. Holmes, but they\u2019ve got a bit over the mark this time.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cStill looking for your boot?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir, and mean to find it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo it was, sir. And now it\u2019s an old black one.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat! you don\u2019t mean to say\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in the\r\n      world\u2014the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers,\r\n      which I am wearing. Last night they took one of my brown ones,\r\n      and today they have sneaked one of the black. Well, have you got\r\n      it? Speak out, man, and don\u2019t stand staring!\u201d\r\n\r\n      An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear\r\n      no word of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, either that boot comes back before sundown or I\u2019ll see the\r\n      manager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt shall be found, sir\u2014I promise you that if you will have a\r\n      little patience it will be found.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMind it is, for it\u2019s the last thing of mine that I\u2019ll lose in\r\n      this den of thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you\u2019ll excuse my\r\n      troubling you about such a trifle\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think it\u2019s well worth troubling about.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, you look very serious over it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do you explain it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI just don\u2019t attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest,\r\n      queerest thing that ever happened to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe queerest perhaps\u2014\u201d said Holmes thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you make of it yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I don\u2019t profess to understand it yet. This case of yours\r\n      is very complex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with your\r\n      uncle\u2019s death I am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of\r\n      capital importance which I have handled there is one which cuts\r\n      so deep. But we hold several threads in our hands, and the odds\r\n      are that one or other of them guides us to the truth. We may\r\n      waste time in following the wrong one, but sooner or later we\r\n      must come upon the right.\u201d\r\n\r\n      We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the\r\n      business which had brought us together. It was in the private\r\n      sitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked\r\n      Baskerville what were his intentions.\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo go to Baskerville Hall.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd when?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt the end of the week.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn the whole,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI think that your decision is a\r\n      wise one. I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in\r\n      London, and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult\r\n      to discover who these people are or what their object can be. If\r\n      their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief, and we\r\n      should be powerless to prevent it. You did not know, Dr.\r\n      Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?\u201d\r\n\r\n      Dr. Mortimer started violently. \u201cFollowed! By whom?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among\r\n      your neighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a\r\n      black, full beard?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo\u2014or, let me see\u2014why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles\u2019s butler, is\r\n      a man with a full, black beard.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHa! Where is Barrymore?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is in charge of the Hall.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any\r\n      possibility he might be in London.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow can you do that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cGive me a telegraph form. \u2018Is all ready for Sir Henry?\u2019 That\r\n      will do. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the\r\n      nearest telegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a\r\n      second wire to the postmaster, Grimpen: \u2018Telegram to Mr.\r\n      Barrymore to be delivered into his own hand. If absent, please\r\n      return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel.\u2019 That\r\n      should let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at his\r\n      post in Devonshire or not.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d said Baskerville. \u201cBy the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is\r\n      this Barrymore, anyhow?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have\r\n      looked after the Hall for four generations now. So far as I know,\r\n      he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the\r\n      county.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt the same time,\u201d said Baskerville, \u201cit\u2019s clear enough that so\r\n      long as there are none of the family at the Hall these people\r\n      have a mighty fine home and nothing to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is true.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles\u2019s will?\u201d asked\r\n      Holmes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe and his wife had five hundred pounds each.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHa! Did they know that they would receive this?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions\r\n      of his will.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is very interesting.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI hope,\u201d said Dr. Mortimer, \u201cthat you do not look with\r\n      suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir\r\n      Charles, for I also had a thousand pounds left to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIndeed! And anyone else?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a large\r\n      number of public charities. The residue all went to Sir Henry.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd how much was the residue?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSeven hundred and forty thousand pounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. \u201cI had no idea that so\r\n      gigantic a sum was involved,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n      \u201cSir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not\r\n      know how very rich he was until we came to examine his\r\n      securities. The total value of the estate was close on to a\r\n      million.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDear me! It is a stake for which a man might well play a\r\n      desperate game. And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Supposing\r\n      that anything happened to our young friend here\u2014you will forgive\r\n      the unpleasant hypothesis!\u2014who would inherit the estate?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSince Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles\u2019s younger brother died\r\n      unmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are\r\n      distant cousins. James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in\r\n      Westmoreland.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you met\r\n      Mr. James Desmond?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of\r\n      venerable appearance and of saintly life. I remember that he\r\n      refused to accept any settlement from Sir Charles, though he\r\n      pressed it upon him.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles\u2019s\r\n      thousands.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. He\r\n      would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed\r\n      otherwise by the present owner, who can, of course, do what he\r\n      likes with it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd have you made your will, Sir Henry?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I\u2019ve had no time, for it was only\r\n      yesterday that I learned how matters stood. But in any case I\r\n      feel that the money should go with the title and estate. That was\r\n      my poor uncle\u2019s idea. How is the owner going to restore the\r\n      glories of the Baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up\r\n      the property? House, land, and dollars must go together.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cQuite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the\r\n      advisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay.\r\n      There is only one provision which I must make. You certainly must\r\n      not go alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDr. Mortimer returns with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house is\r\n      miles away from yours. With all the goodwill in the world he may\r\n      be unable to help you. No, Sir Henry, you must take with you\r\n      someone, a trusty man, who will be always by your side.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in\r\n      person; but you can understand that, with my extensive consulting\r\n      practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many\r\n      quarters, it is impossible for me to be absent from London for an\r\n      indefinite time. At the present instant one of the most revered\r\n      names in England is being besmirched by a blackmailer, and only I\r\n      can stop a disastrous scandal. You will see how impossible it is\r\n      for me to go to Dartmoor.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhom would you recommend, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes laid his hand upon my arm. \u201cIf my friend would undertake\r\n      it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when\r\n      you are in a tight place. No one can say so more confidently than\r\n      I.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had\r\n      time to answer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it\r\n      heartily.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cYou\r\n      see how it is with me, and you know just as much about the matter\r\n      as I do. If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me\r\n      through I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I\r\n      was complimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with\r\n      which the baronet hailed me as a companion.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will come, with pleasure,\u201d said I. \u201cI do not know how I could\r\n      employ my time better.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you will report very carefully to me,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWhen a\r\n      crisis comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. I\r\n      suppose that by Saturday all might be ready?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWould that suit Dr. Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerfectly.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet\r\n      at the ten-thirty train from Paddington.\u201d\r\n\r\n      We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry of triumph,\r\n      and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown\r\n      boot from under a cabinet.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy missing boot!\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMay all our difficulties vanish as easily!\u201d said Sherlock\r\n      Holmes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut it is a very singular thing,\u201d Dr. Mortimer remarked. \u201cI\r\n      searched this room carefully before lunch.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd so did I,\u201d said Baskerville. \u201cEvery inch of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere was certainly no boot in it then.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were\r\n      lunching.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the\r\n      matter, nor could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been\r\n      added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small\r\n      mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly. Setting\r\n      aside the whole grim story of Sir Charles\u2019s death, we had a line\r\n      of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days,\r\n      which included the receipt of the printed letter, the\r\n      black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown boot,\r\n      the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new\r\n      brown boot. Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to\r\n      Baker Street, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that\r\n      his mind, like my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some\r\n      scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected\r\n      episodes could be fitted. All afternoon and late into the evening\r\n      he sat lost in tobacco and thought.\r\n\r\n      Just before dinner two telegrams were handed in. The first ran:\r\n\r\n      Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall. BASKERVILLE.\r\n\r\n      The second:\r\n\r\n      Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry to report\r\n      unable to trace cut sheet of _Times_. CARTWRIGHT.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more\r\n      stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. We\r\n      must cast round for another scent.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe have still the cabman who drove the spy.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly. I have wired to get his name and address from the\r\n      Official Registry. I should not be surprised if this were an\r\n      answer to my question.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The ring at the bell proved to be something even more\r\n      satisfactory than an answer, however, for the door opened and a\r\n      rough-looking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI got a message from the head office that a gent at this address\r\n      had been inquiring for No. 2704,\u201d said he. \u201cI\u2019ve driven my cab\r\n      this seven years and never a word of complaint. I came here\r\n      straight from the Yard to ask you to your face what you had\r\n      against me.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have nothing in the world against you, my good man,\u201d said\r\n      Holmes. \u201cOn the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you\r\n      will give me a clear answer to my questions.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I\u2019ve had a good day and no mistake,\u201d said the cabman with\r\n      a grin. \u201cWhat was it you wanted to ask, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cFirst of all your name and address, in case I want you again.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cJohn Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out of\r\n      Shipley\u2019s Yard, near Waterloo Station.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Sherlock Holmes made a note of it.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched\r\n      this house at ten o\u2019clock this morning and afterwards followed\r\n      the two gentlemen down Regent Street.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. \u201cWhy, there\u2019s\r\n      no good my telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I\r\n      do already,\u201d said he. \u201cThe truth is that the gentleman told me\r\n      that he was a detective and that I was to say nothing about him\r\n      to anyone.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you may\r\n      find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide\r\n      anything from me. You say that your fare told you that he was a\r\n      detective?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, he did.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen did he say this?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen he left me.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid he say anything more?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe mentioned his name.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. \u201cOh, he mentioned\r\n      his name, did he? That was imprudent. What was the name that he\r\n      mentioned?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHis name,\u201d said the cabman, \u201cwas Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by\r\n      the cabman\u2019s reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement.\r\n      Then he burst into a hearty laugh.\r\n\r\n      \u201cA touch, Watson\u2014an undeniable touch!\u201d said he. \u201cI feel a foil as\r\n      quick and supple as my own. He got home upon me very prettily\r\n      that time. So his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir, that was the gentleman\u2019s name.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExcellent! Tell me where you picked him up and all that\r\n      occurred.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square. He said that\r\n      he was a detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would do\r\n      exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions. I was glad\r\n      enough to agree. First we drove down to the Northumberland Hotel\r\n      and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from\r\n      the rank. We followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near\r\n      here.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis very door,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew\r\n      all about it. We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an\r\n      hour and a half. Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and\r\n      we followed down Baker Street and along\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI know,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cUntil we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my\r\n      gentleman threw up the trap, and he cried that I should drive\r\n      right away to Waterloo Station as hard as I could go. I whipped\r\n      up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes. Then he paid\r\n      up his two guineas, like a good one, and away he went into the\r\n      station. Only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said:\r\n      \u2018It might interest you to know that you have been driving Mr.\r\n      Sherlock Holmes.\u2019 That\u2019s how I come to know the name.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI see. And you saw no more of him?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot after he went into the station.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n      The cabman scratched his head. \u201cWell, he wasn\u2019t altogether such\r\n      an easy gentleman to describe. I\u2019d put him at forty years of age,\r\n      and he was of a middle height, two or three inches shorter than\r\n      you, sir. He was dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard,\r\n      cut square at the end, and a pale face. I don\u2019t know as I could\r\n      say more than that.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cColour of his eyes?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, I can\u2019t say that.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing more that you can remember?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, sir; nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, then, here is your half-sovereign. There\u2019s another one\r\n      waiting for you if you can bring any more information.\r\n      Good-night!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood-night, sir, and thank you!\u201d\r\n\r\n      John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a\r\n      shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile.\r\n\r\n      \u201cSnap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,\u201d said he.\r\n      \u201cThe cunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry\r\n      Baskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street,\r\n      conjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my\r\n      hands on the driver, and so sent back this audacious message. I\r\n      tell you, Watson, this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of\r\n      our steel. I\u2019ve been checkmated in London. I can only wish you\r\n      better luck in Devonshire. But I\u2019m not easy in my mind about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAbout what?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAbout sending you. It\u2019s an ugly business, Watson, an ugly\r\n      dangerous business, and the more I see of it the less I like it.\r\n      Yes, my dear fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I\r\n      shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in Baker\r\n      Street once more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6.\r\nBaskerville Hall\r\n\r\n\r\n      Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the\r\n      appointed day, and we started as arranged for Devonshire. Mr.\r\n      Sherlock Holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his last\r\n      parting injunctions and advice.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions,\r\n      Watson,\u201d said he; \u201cI wish you simply to report facts in the\r\n      fullest possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the\r\n      theorizing.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat sort of facts?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon\r\n      the case, and especially the relations between young Baskerville\r\n      and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death\r\n      of Sir Charles. I have made some inquiries myself in the last few\r\n      days, but the results have, I fear, been negative. One thing only\r\n      appears to be certain, and that is that Mr. James Desmond, who is\r\n      the next heir, is an elderly gentleman of a very amiable\r\n      disposition, so that this persecution does not arise from him. I\r\n      really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our\r\n      calculations. There remain the people who will actually surround\r\n      Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWould it not be well in the first place to get rid of this\r\n      Barrymore couple?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBy no means. You could not make a greater mistake. If they are\r\n      innocent it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we\r\n      should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them. No,\r\n      no, we will preserve them upon our list of suspects. Then there\r\n      is a groom at the Hall, if I remember right. There are two\r\n      moorland farmers. There is our friend Dr. Mortimer, whom I\r\n      believe to be entirely honest, and there is his wife, of whom we\r\n      know nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton, and there is\r\n      his sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions. There\r\n      is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor,\r\n      and there are one or two other neighbours. These are the folk who\r\n      must be your very special study.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will do my best.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have arms, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, I thought it as well to take them.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMost certainly. Keep your revolver near you night and day, and\r\n      never relax your precautions.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Our friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were\r\n      waiting for us upon the platform.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, we have no news of any kind,\u201d said Dr. Mortimer in answer to\r\n      my friend\u2019s questions. \u201cI can swear to one thing, and that is\r\n      that we have not been shadowed during the last two days. We have\r\n      never gone out without keeping a sharp watch, and no one could\r\n      have escaped our notice.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have always kept together, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExcept yesterday afternoon. I usually give up one day to pure\r\n      amusement when I come to town, so I spent it at the Museum of the\r\n      College of Surgeons.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd I went to look at the folk in the park,\u201d said Baskerville.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut we had no trouble of any kind.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was imprudent, all the same,\u201d said Holmes, shaking his head\r\n      and looking very grave. \u201cI beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go\r\n      about alone. Some great misfortune will befall you if you do. Did\r\n      you get your other boot?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, sir, it is gone forever.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIndeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-bye,\u201d he added as\r\n      the train began to glide down the platform. \u201cBear in mind, Sir\r\n      Henry, one of the phrases in that queer old legend which Dr.\r\n      Mortimer has read to us, and avoid the moor in those hours of\r\n      darkness when the powers of evil are exalted.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and\r\n      saw the tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and\r\n      gazing after us.\r\n\r\n      The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it in\r\n      making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in\r\n      playing with Dr. Mortimer\u2019s spaniel. In a very few hours the\r\n      brown earth had become ruddy, the brick had changed to granite,\r\n      and red cows grazed in well-hedged fields where the lush grasses\r\n      and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer, if a damper,\r\n      climate. Young Baskerville stared eagerly out of the window and\r\n      cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar features\r\n      of the Devon scenery.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ve been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr.\r\n      Watson,\u201d said he; \u201cbut I have never seen a place to compare with\r\n      it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his county,\u201d I\r\n      remarked.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the\r\n      county,\u201d said Dr. Mortimer. \u201cA glance at our friend here reveals\r\n      the rounded head of the Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic\r\n      enthusiasm and power of attachment. Poor Sir Charles\u2019s head was\r\n      of a very rare type, half Gaelic, half Ivernian in its\r\n      characteristics. But you were very young when you last saw\r\n      Baskerville Hall, were you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was a boy in my teens at the time of my father\u2019s death and had\r\n      never seen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the\r\n      South Coast. Thence I went straight to a friend in America. I\r\n      tell you it is all as new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I\u2019m\r\n      as keen as possible to see the moor.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you? Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your\r\n      first sight of the moor,\u201d said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the\r\n      carriage window.\r\n\r\n      Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood\r\n      there rose in the distance a grey, melancholy hill, with a\r\n      strange jagged summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some\r\n      fantastic landscape in a dream. Baskerville sat for a long time,\r\n      his eyes fixed upon it, and I read upon his eager face how much\r\n      it meant to him, this first sight of that strange spot where the\r\n      men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so\r\n      deep. There he sat, with his tweed suit and his American accent,\r\n      in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as I looked\r\n      at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true a\r\n      descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and\r\n      masterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in his\r\n      thick brows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. If\r\n      on that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should\r\n      lie before us, this was at least a comrade for whom one might\r\n      venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely\r\n      share it.\r\n\r\n      The train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all\r\n      descended. Outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with\r\n      a pair of cobs was waiting. Our coming was evidently a great\r\n      event, for station-master and porters clustered round us to carry\r\n      out our luggage. It was a sweet, simple country spot, but I was\r\n      surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly\r\n      men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short rifles and\r\n      glanced keenly at us as we passed. The coachman, a hard-faced,\r\n      gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in a\r\n      few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road.\r\n      Rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and old\r\n      gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but\r\n      behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose ever, dark\r\n      against the evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the moor,\r\n      broken by the jagged and sinister hills.\r\n\r\n      The wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward\r\n      through deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks on\r\n      either side, heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hart\u2019s-tongue\r\n      ferns. Bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the light\r\n      of the sinking sun. Still steadily rising, we passed over a\r\n      narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy stream which gushed\r\n      swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the grey boulders. Both\r\n      road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak\r\n      and fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of\r\n      delight, looking eagerly about him and asking countless\r\n      questions. To his eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of\r\n      melancholy lay upon the countryside, which bore so clearly the\r\n      mark of the waning year. Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and\r\n      fluttered down upon us as we passed. The rattle of our wheels\r\n      died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation\u2014sad\r\n      gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw before the\r\n      carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHalloa!\u201d cried Dr. Mortimer, \u201cwhat is this?\u201d\r\n\r\n      A steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor,\r\n      lay in front of us. On the summit, hard and clear like an\r\n      equestrian statue upon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark\r\n      and stern, his rifle poised ready over his forearm. He was\r\n      watching the road along which we travelled.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is this, Perkins?\u201d asked Dr. Mortimer.\r\n\r\n      Our driver half turned in his seat. \u201cThere\u2019s a convict escaped\r\n      from Princetown, sir. He\u2019s been out three days now, and the\r\n      warders watch every road and every station, but they\u2019ve had no\r\n      sight of him yet. The farmers about here don\u2019t like it, sir, and\r\n      that\u2019s a fact.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give\r\n      information.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing\r\n      compared to the chance of having your throat cut. You see, it\r\n      isn\u2019t like any ordinary convict. This is a man that would stick\r\n      at nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho is he, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes had\r\n      taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the\r\n      crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions\r\n      of the assassin. The commutation of his death sentence had been\r\n      due to some doubts as to his complete sanity, so atrocious was\r\n      his conduct. Our wagonette had topped a rise and in front of us\r\n      rose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled with gnarled and\r\n      craggy cairns and tors. A cold wind swept down from it and set us\r\n      shivering. Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was lurking\r\n      this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his\r\n      heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast\r\n      him out. It needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness\r\n      of the barren waste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky.\r\n      Even Baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely\r\n      around him.\r\n\r\n      We had left the fertile country behind and beneath us. We looked\r\n      back on it now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the\r\n      streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new\r\n      turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands. The\r\n      road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and\r\n      olive slopes, sprinkled with giant boulders. Now and then we\r\n      passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone, with no\r\n      creeper to break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down into\r\n      a cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs which\r\n      had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm. Two\r\n      high, narrow towers rose over the trees. The driver pointed with\r\n      his whip.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBaskerville Hall,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n      Its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and\r\n      shining eyes. A few minutes later we had reached the lodge-gates,\r\n      a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron, with weather-bitten\r\n      pillars on either side, blotched with lichens, and surmounted by\r\n      the boars\u2019 heads of the Baskervilles. The lodge was a ruin of\r\n      black granite and bared ribs of rafters, but facing it was a new\r\n      building, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir Charles\u2019s\r\n      South African gold.\r\n\r\n      Through the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels\r\n      were again hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their\r\n      branches in a sombre tunnel over our heads. Baskerville shuddered\r\n      as he looked up the long, dark drive to where the house glimmered\r\n      like a ghost at the farther end.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWas it here?\u201d he asked in a low voice.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no, the yew alley is on the other side.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The young heir glanced round with a gloomy face.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in\r\n      such a place as this,\u201d said he. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to scare any man.\r\n      I\u2019ll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months,\r\n      and you won\u2019t know it again, with a thousand candle-power Swan\r\n      and Edison right here in front of the hall door.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay\r\n      before us. In the fading light I could see that the centre was a\r\n      heavy block of building from which a porch projected. The whole\r\n      front was draped in ivy, with a patch clipped bare here and there\r\n      where a window or a coat of arms broke through the dark veil.\r\n      From this central block rose the twin towers, ancient,\r\n      crenelated, and pierced with many loopholes. To right and left of\r\n      the turrets were more modern wings of black granite. A dull light\r\n      shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high chimneys\r\n      which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a single\r\n      black column of smoke.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWelcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville Hall!\u201d\r\n\r\n      A tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the\r\n      door of the wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouetted\r\n      against the yellow light of the hall. She came out and helped the\r\n      man to hand down our bags.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou don\u2019t mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?\u201d said Dr.\r\n      Mortimer. \u201cMy wife is expecting me.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSurely you will stay and have some dinner?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me. I\r\n      would stay to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a\r\n      better guide than I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to\r\n      send for me if I can be of service.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned\r\n      into the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It was a\r\n      fine apartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and\r\n      heavily raftered with huge baulks of age-blackened oak. In the\r\n      great old-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a\r\n      log-fire crackled and snapped. Sir Henry and I held out our hands\r\n      to it, for we were numb from our long drive. Then we gazed round\r\n      us at the high, thin window of old stained glass, the oak\r\n      panelling, the stags\u2019 heads, the coats of arms upon the walls,\r\n      all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s just as I imagined it,\u201d said Sir Henry. \u201cIs it not the very\r\n      picture of an old family home? To think that this should be the\r\n      same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived.\r\n      It strikes me solemn to think of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed\r\n      about him. The light beat upon him where he stood, but long\r\n      shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above\r\n      him. Barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms.\r\n      He stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of a\r\n      well-trained servant. He was a remarkable-looking man, tall,\r\n      handsome, with a square black beard and pale, distinguished\r\n      features.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWould you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs it ready?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water in your\r\n      rooms. My wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you\r\n      until you have made your fresh arrangements, but you will\r\n      understand that under the new conditions this house will require\r\n      a considerable staff.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat new conditions?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and\r\n      we were able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish\r\n      to have more company, and so you will need changes in your\r\n      household.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOnly when it is quite convenient to you, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut your family have been with us for several generations, have\r\n      they not? I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an\r\n      old family connection.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler\u2019s white\r\n      face.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. But to tell the\r\n      truth, sir, we were both very much attached to Sir Charles, and\r\n      his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very\r\n      painful to us. I fear that we shall never again be easy in our\r\n      minds at Baskerville Hall.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut what do you intend to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishing\r\n      ourselves in some business. Sir Charles\u2019s generosity has given us\r\n      the means to do so. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to\r\n      your rooms.\u201d\r\n\r\n      A square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall,\r\n      approached by a double stair. From this central point two long\r\n      corridors extended the whole length of the building, from which\r\n      all the bedrooms opened. My own was in the same wing as\r\n      Baskerville\u2019s and almost next door to it. These rooms appeared to\r\n      be much more modern than the central part of the house, and the\r\n      bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the\r\n      sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind.\r\n\r\n      But the dining-room which opened out of the hall was a place of\r\n      shadow and gloom. It was a long chamber with a step separating\r\n      the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for\r\n      their dependents. At one end a minstrel\u2019s gallery overlooked it.\r\n      Black beams shot across above our heads, with a smoke-darkened\r\n      ceiling beyond them. With rows of flaring torches to light it up,\r\n      and the colour and rude hilarity of an old-time banquet, it might\r\n      have softened; but now, when two black-clothed gentlemen sat in\r\n      the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one\u2019s voice\r\n      became hushed and one\u2019s spirit subdued. A dim line of ancestors,\r\n      in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan knight to the\r\n      buck of the Regency, stared down upon us and daunted us by their\r\n      silent company. We talked little, and I for one was glad when the\r\n      meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern\r\n      billiard-room and smoke a cigarette.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy word, it isn\u2019t a very cheerful place,\u201d said Sir Henry. \u201cI\r\n      suppose one can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of the\r\n      picture at present. I don\u2019t wonder that my uncle got a little\r\n      jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this. However, if\r\n      it suits you, we will retire early tonight, and perhaps things\r\n      may seem more cheerful in the morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I drew aside my curtains before I went to bed and looked out from\r\n      my window. It opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of\r\n      the hall door. Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung in a\r\n      rising wind. A half moon broke through the rifts of racing\r\n      clouds. In its cold light I saw beyond the trees a broken fringe\r\n      of rocks, and the long, low curve of the melancholy moor. I\r\n      closed the curtain, feeling that my last impression was in\r\n      keeping with the rest.\r\n\r\n      And yet it was not quite the last. I found myself weary and yet\r\n      wakeful, tossing restlessly from side to side, seeking for the\r\n      sleep which would not come. Far away a chiming clock struck out\r\n      the quarters of the hours, but otherwise a deathly silence lay\r\n      upon the old house. And then suddenly, in the very dead of the\r\n      night, there came a sound to my ears, clear, resonant, and\r\n      unmistakable. It was the sob of a woman, the muffled, strangling\r\n      gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow. I sat up in\r\n      bed and listened intently. The noise could not have been far away\r\n      and was certainly in the house. For half an hour I waited with\r\n      every nerve on the alert, but there came no other sound save the\r\n      chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7.\r\nThe Stapletons of Merripit House\r\n\r\n\r\n      The fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface\r\n      from our minds the grim and grey impression which had been left\r\n      upon both of us by our first experience of Baskerville Hall. As\r\n      Sir Henry and I sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through\r\n      the high mullioned windows, throwing watery patches of colour\r\n      from the coats of arms which covered them. The dark panelling\r\n      glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it was hard to realise\r\n      that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom\r\n      into our souls upon the evening before.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to\r\n      blame!\u201d said the baronet. \u201cWe were tired with our journey and\r\n      chilled by our drive, so we took a grey view of the place. Now we\r\n      are fresh and well, so it is all cheerful once more.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd yet it was not entirely a question of imagination,\u201d I\r\n      answered. \u201cDid you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman\r\n      I think, sobbing in the night?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I\r\n      heard something of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was\r\n      no more of it, so I concluded that it was all a dream.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob\r\n      of a woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe must ask about this right away.\u201d He rang the bell and asked\r\n      Barrymore whether he could account for our experience. It seemed\r\n      to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler\r\n      still as he listened to his master\u2019s question.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are only two women in the house, Sir Henry,\u201d he answered.\r\n      \u201cOne is the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The\r\n      other is my wife, and I can answer for it that the sound could\r\n      not have come from her.\u201d\r\n\r\n      And yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that after\r\n      breakfast I met Mrs. Barrymore in the long corridor with the sun\r\n      full upon her face. She was a large, impassive, heavy-featured\r\n      woman with a stern set expression of mouth. But her telltale eyes\r\n      were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids. It was she,\r\n      then, who wept in the night, and if she did so her husband must\r\n      know it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in\r\n      declaring that it was not so. Why had he done this? And why did\r\n      she weep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome,\r\n      black-bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery\r\n      and of gloom. It was he who had been the first to discover the\r\n      body of Sir Charles, and we had only his word for all the\r\n      circumstances which led up to the old man\u2019s death. Was it\r\n      possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had seen in\r\n      the cab in Regent Street? The beard might well have been the\r\n      same. The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such\r\n      an impression might easily have been erroneous. How could I\r\n      settle the point forever? Obviously the first thing to do was to\r\n      see the Grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram had\r\n      really been placed in Barrymore\u2019s own hands. Be the answer what\r\n      it might, I should at least have something to report to Sherlock\r\n      Holmes.\r\n\r\n      Sir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that\r\n      the time was propitious for my excursion. It was a pleasant walk\r\n      of four miles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a\r\n      small grey hamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to\r\n      be the inn and the house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the\r\n      rest. The postmaster, who was also the village grocer, had a\r\n      clear recollection of the telegram.\r\n\r\n      \u201cCertainly, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cI had the telegram delivered to Mr.\r\n      Barrymore exactly as directed.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho delivered it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy boy here. James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore\r\n      at the Hall last week, did you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, father, I delivered it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cInto his own hands?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put\r\n      it into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore\u2019s hands,\r\n      and she promised to deliver it at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid you see Mr. Barrymore?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, sir; I tell you he was in the loft.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you didn\u2019t see him, how do you know he was in the loft?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, surely his own wife ought to know where he is,\u201d said the\r\n      postmaster testily. \u201cDidn\u2019t he get the telegram? If there is any\r\n      mistake it is for Mr. Barrymore himself to complain.\u201d\r\n\r\n      It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was\r\n      clear that in spite of Holmes\u2019s ruse we had no proof that\r\n      Barrymore had not been in London all the time. Suppose that it\r\n      were so\u2014suppose that the same man had been the last who had seen\r\n      Sir Charles alive, and the first to dog the new heir when he\r\n      returned to England. What then? Was he the agent of others or had\r\n      he some sinister design of his own? What interest could he have\r\n      in persecuting the Baskerville family? I thought of the strange\r\n      warning clipped out of the leading article of the _Times_. Was\r\n      that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was\r\n      bent upon counteracting his schemes? The only conceivable motive\r\n      was that which had been suggested by Sir Henry, that if the\r\n      family could be scared away a comfortable and permanent home\r\n      would be secured for the Barrymores. But surely such an\r\n      explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the\r\n      deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible\r\n      net round the young baronet. Holmes himself had said that no more\r\n      complex case had come to him in all the long series of his\r\n      sensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along the\r\n      grey, lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his\r\n      preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of\r\n      responsibility from my shoulders.\r\n\r\n      Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running\r\n      feet behind me and by a voice which called me by name. I turned,\r\n      expecting to see Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a\r\n      stranger who was pursuing me. He was a small, slim, clean-shaven,\r\n      prim-faced man, flaxen-haired and lean-jawed, between thirty and\r\n      forty years of age, dressed in a grey suit and wearing a straw\r\n      hat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and\r\n      he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his hands.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson,\u201d said he\r\n      as he came panting up to where I stood. \u201cHere on the moor we are\r\n      homely folk and do not wait for formal introductions. You may\r\n      possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. I\r\n      am Stapleton, of Merripit House.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYour net and box would have told me as much,\u201d said I, \u201cfor I\r\n      knew that Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you know\r\n      me?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to me\r\n      from the window of his surgery as you passed. As our road lay the\r\n      same way I thought that I would overtake you and introduce\r\n      myself. I trust that Sir Henry is none the worse for his\r\n      journey?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is very well, thank you.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir\r\n      Charles the new baronet might refuse to live here. It is asking\r\n      much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of\r\n      this kind, but I need not tell you that it means a very great\r\n      deal to the countryside. Sir Henry has, I suppose, no\r\n      superstitious fears in the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI do not think that it is likely.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOf course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the\r\n      family?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have heard it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here!\r\n      Any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a\r\n      creature upon the moor.\u201d He spoke with a smile, but I seemed to\r\n      read in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously. \u201cThe\r\n      story took a great hold upon the imagination of Sir Charles, and\r\n      I have no doubt that it led to his tragic end.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut how?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHis nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog\r\n      might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. I fancy\r\n      that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night\r\n      in the yew alley. I feared that some disaster might occur, for I\r\n      was very fond of the old man, and I knew that his heart was\r\n      weak.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy friend Mortimer told me.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he\r\n      died of fright in consequence?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you any better explanation?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have not come to any conclusion.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHas Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n      The words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the\r\n      placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no\r\n      surprise was intended.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr.\r\n      Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cThe records of your detective have reached us\r\n      here, and you could not celebrate him without being known\r\n      yourself. When Mortimer told me your name he could not deny your\r\n      identity. If you are here, then it follows that Mr. Sherlock\r\n      Holmes is interesting himself in the matter, and I am naturally\r\n      curious to know what view he may take.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am afraid that I cannot answer that question.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMay I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe cannot leave town at present. He has other cases which engage\r\n      his attention.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat a pity! He might throw some light on that which is so dark\r\n      to us. But as to your own researches, if there is any possible\r\n      way in which I can be of service to you I trust that you will\r\n      command me. If I had any indication of the nature of your\r\n      suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case, I might\r\n      perhaps even now give you some aid or advice.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend,\r\n      Sir Henry, and that I need no help of any kind.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExcellent!\u201d said Stapleton. \u201cYou are perfectly right to be wary\r\n      and discreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an\r\n      unjustifiable intrusion, and I promise you that I will not\r\n      mention the matter again.\u201d\r\n\r\n      We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from\r\n      the road and wound away across the moor. A steep,\r\n      boulder-sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone\r\n      days been cut into a granite quarry. The face which was turned\r\n      towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and brambles growing\r\n      in its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a grey\r\n      plume of smoke.\r\n\r\n      \u201cA moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit\r\n      House,\u201d said he. \u201cPerhaps you will spare an hour that I may have\r\n      the pleasure of introducing you to my sister.\u201d\r\n\r\n      My first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry\u2019s side. But\r\n      then I remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his\r\n      study table was littered. It was certain that I could not help\r\n      with those. And Holmes had expressly said that I should study the\r\n      neighbours upon the moor. I accepted Stapleton\u2019s invitation, and\r\n      we turned together down the path.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is a wonderful place, the moor,\u201d said he, looking round over\r\n      the undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged\r\n      granite foaming up into fantastic surges. \u201cYou never tire of the\r\n      moor. You cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains.\r\n      It is so vast, and so barren, and so mysterious.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou know it well, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have only been here two years. The residents would call me a\r\n      newcomer. We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But my\r\n      tastes led me to explore every part of the country round, and I\r\n      should think that there are few men who know it better than I\r\n      do.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs it hard to know?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery hard. You see, for example, this great plain to the north\r\n      here with the queer hills breaking out of it. Do you observe\r\n      anything remarkable about that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt would be a rare place for a gallop.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou would naturally think so and the thought has cost several\r\n      their lives before now. You notice those bright green spots\r\n      scattered thickly over it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, they seem more fertile than the rest.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Stapleton laughed. \u201cThat is the great Grimpen Mire,\u201d said he. \u201cA\r\n      false step yonder means death to man or beast. Only yesterday I\r\n      saw one of the moor ponies wander into it. He never came out. I\r\n      saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog-hole,\r\n      but it sucked him down at last. Even in dry seasons it is a\r\n      danger to cross it, but after these autumn rains it is an awful\r\n      place. And yet I can find my way to the very heart of it and\r\n      return alive. By George, there is another of those miserable\r\n      ponies!\u201d\r\n\r\n      Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges.\r\n      Then a long, agonised, writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful\r\n      cry echoed over the moor. It turned me cold with horror, but my\r\n      companion\u2019s nerves seemed to be stronger than mine.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s gone!\u201d said he. \u201cThe mire has him. Two in two days, and\r\n      many more, perhaps, for they get in the way of going there in the\r\n      dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them\r\n      in its clutches. It\u2019s a bad place, the great Grimpen Mire.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you say you can penetrate it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can\r\n      take. I have found them out.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, you see the hills beyond? They are really islands cut off\r\n      on all sides by the impassable mire, which has crawled round them\r\n      in the course of years. That is where the rare plants and the\r\n      butterflies are, if you have the wit to reach them.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI shall try my luck some day.\u201d\r\n\r\n      He looked at me with a surprised face. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake put such\r\n      an idea out of your mind,\u201d said he. \u201cYour blood would be upon my\r\n      head. I assure you that there would not be the least chance of\r\n      your coming back alive. It is only by remembering certain complex\r\n      landmarks that I am able to do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHalloa!\u201d I cried. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      A long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. It\r\n      filled the whole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it\r\n      came. From a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then\r\n      sank back into a melancholy, throbbing murmur once again.\r\n      Stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face.\r\n\r\n      \u201cQueer place, the moor!\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut what is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for\r\n      its prey. I\u2019ve heard it once or twice before, but never quite so\r\n      loud.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge\r\n      swelling plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothing\r\n      stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which\r\n      croaked loudly from a tor behind us.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are an educated man. You don\u2019t believe such nonsense as\r\n      that?\u201d said I. \u201cWhat do you think is the cause of so strange a\r\n      sound?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBogs make queer noises sometimes. It\u2019s the mud settling, or the\r\n      water rising, or something.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no, that was a living voice.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, I never did.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s a very rare bird\u2014practically extinct\u2014in England now, but\r\n      all things are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be\r\n      surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last\r\n      of the bitterns.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my\r\n      life.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, it\u2019s rather an uncanny place altogether. Look at the\r\n      hillside yonder. What do you make of those?\u201d\r\n\r\n      The whole steep slope was covered with grey circular rings of\r\n      stone, a score of them at least.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat are they? Sheep-pens?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors. Prehistoric man\r\n      lived thickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has lived\r\n      there since, we find all his little arrangements exactly as he\r\n      left them. These are his wigwams with the roofs off. You can even\r\n      see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go\r\n      inside.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNeolithic man\u2014no date.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for\r\n      tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look\r\n      at the great trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes,\r\n      you will find some very singular points about the moor, Dr.\r\n      Watson. Oh, excuse me an instant! It is surely Cyclopides.\u201d\r\n\r\n      A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an\r\n      instant Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed\r\n      in pursuit of it. To my dismay the creature flew straight for the\r\n      great mire, and my acquaintance never paused for an instant,\r\n      bounding from tuft to tuft behind it, his green net waving in the\r\n      air. His grey clothes and jerky, zigzag, irregular progress made\r\n      him not unlike some huge moth himself. I was standing watching\r\n      his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary\r\n      activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the\r\n      treacherous mire, when I heard the sound of steps and, turning\r\n      round, found a woman near me upon the path. She had come from the\r\n      direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of\r\n      Merripit House, but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was\r\n      quite close.\r\n\r\n      I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had\r\n      been told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor,\r\n      and I remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a\r\n      beauty. The woman who approached me was certainly that, and of a\r\n      most uncommon type. There could not have been a greater contrast\r\n      between brother and sister, for Stapleton was neutral tinted,\r\n      with light hair and grey eyes, while she was darker than any\r\n      brunette whom I have seen in England\u2014slim, elegant, and tall. She\r\n      had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it might have\r\n      seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the\r\n      beautiful dark, eager eyes. With her perfect figure and elegant\r\n      dress she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely\r\n      moorland path. Her eyes were on her brother as I turned, and then\r\n      she quickened her pace towards me. I had raised my hat and was\r\n      about to make some explanatory remark when her own words turned\r\n      all my thoughts into a new channel.\r\n\r\n      \u201cGo back!\u201d she said. \u201cGo straight back to London, instantly.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I could only stare at her in stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed at\r\n      me, and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy should I go back?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI cannot explain.\u201d She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a\r\n      curious lisp in her utterance. \u201cBut for God\u2019s sake do what I ask\r\n      you. Go back and never set foot upon the moor again.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut I have only just come.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMan, man!\u201d she cried. \u201cCan you not tell when a warning is for\r\n      your own good? Go back to London! Start tonight! Get away from\r\n      this place at all costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word\r\n      of what I have said. Would you mind getting that orchid for me\r\n      among the mare\u2019s-tails yonder? We are very rich in orchids on the\r\n      moor, though, of course, you are rather late to see the beauties\r\n      of the place.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing\r\n      hard and flushed with his exertions.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHalloa, Beryl!\u201d said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of\r\n      his greeting was not altogether a cordial one.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, Jack, you are very hot.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom\r\n      found in the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed\r\n      him!\u201d He spoke unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced\r\n      incessantly from the girl to me.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have introduced yourselves, I can see.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to\r\n      see the true beauties of the moor.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, who do you think this is?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no,\u201d said I. \u201cOnly a humble commoner, but his friend. My\r\n      name is Dr. Watson.\u201d\r\n\r\n      A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. \u201cWe have\r\n      been talking at cross purposes,\u201d said she.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, you had not very much time for talk,\u201d her brother remarked\r\n      with the same questioning eyes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being\r\n      merely a visitor,\u201d said she. \u201cIt cannot much matter to him\r\n      whether it is early or late for the orchids. But you will come\r\n      on, will you not, and see Merripit House?\u201d\r\n\r\n      A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the\r\n      farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into\r\n      repair and turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded\r\n      it, but the trees, as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and\r\n      nipped, and the effect of the whole place was mean and\r\n      melancholy. We were admitted by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated\r\n      old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the house. Inside,\r\n      however, there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in\r\n      which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I looked\r\n      from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor\r\n      rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel\r\n      at what could have brought this highly educated man and this\r\n      beautiful woman to live in such a place.\r\n\r\n      \u201cQueer spot to choose, is it not?\u201d said he as if in answer to my\r\n      thought. \u201cAnd yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we\r\n      not, Beryl?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cQuite happy,\u201d said she, but there was no ring of conviction in\r\n      her words.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI had a school,\u201d said Stapleton. \u201cIt was in the north country.\r\n      The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and\r\n      uninteresting, but the privilege of living with youth, of helping\r\n      to mould those young minds, and of impressing them with one\u2019s own\r\n      character and ideals was very dear to me. However, the fates were\r\n      against us. A serious epidemic broke out in the school and three\r\n      of the boys died. It never recovered from the blow, and much of\r\n      my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet, if it were\r\n      not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys, I\r\n      could rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes\r\n      for botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here,\r\n      and my sister is as devoted to Nature as I am. All this, Dr.\r\n      Watson, has been brought upon your head by your expression as you\r\n      surveyed the moor out of our window.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little\r\n      dull\u2014less for you, perhaps, than for your sister.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no, I am never dull,\u201d said she quickly.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting\r\n      neighbours. Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line.\r\n      Poor Sir Charles was also an admirable companion. We knew him\r\n      well and miss him more than I can tell. Do you think that I\r\n      should intrude if I were to call this afternoon and make the\r\n      acquaintance of Sir Henry?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am sure that he would be delighted.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may\r\n      in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him\r\n      until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings. Will you\r\n      come upstairs, Dr. Watson, and inspect my collection of\r\n      Lepidoptera? I think it is the most complete one in the\r\n      south-west of England. By the time that you have looked through\r\n      them lunch will be almost ready.\u201d\r\n\r\n      But I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the\r\n      moor, the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which\r\n      had been associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all\r\n      these things tinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of\r\n      these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite\r\n      and distinct warning of Miss Stapleton, delivered with such\r\n      intense earnestness that I could not doubt that some grave and\r\n      deep reason lay behind it. I resisted all pressure to stay for\r\n      lunch, and I set off at once upon my return journey, taking the\r\n      grass-grown path by which we had come.\r\n\r\n      It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for\r\n      those who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was\r\n      astounded to see Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side\r\n      of the track. Her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions\r\n      and she held her hand to her side.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson,\u201d\r\n      said she. \u201cI had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop,\r\n      or my brother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am\r\n      about the stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir\r\n      Henry. Please forget the words I said, which have no application\r\n      whatever to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut I can\u2019t forget them, Miss Stapleton,\u201d said I. \u201cI am Sir\r\n      Henry\u2019s friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine.\r\n      Tell me why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should\r\n      return to London.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cA woman\u2019s whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will\r\n      understand that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or\r\n      do.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the look\r\n      in your eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton,\r\n      for ever since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows\r\n      all round me. Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with\r\n      little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with\r\n      no guide to point the track. Tell me then what it was that you\r\n      meant, and I will promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry.\u201d\r\n\r\n      An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her\r\n      face, but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou make too much of it, Dr. Watson,\u201d said she. \u201cMy brother and\r\n      I were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him\r\n      very intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our\r\n      house. He was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the\r\n      family, and when this tragedy came I naturally felt that there\r\n      must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed. I was\r\n      distressed therefore when another member of the family came down\r\n      to live here, and I felt that he should be warned of the danger\r\n      which he will run. That was all which I intended to convey.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut what is the danger?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou know the story of the hound?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI do not believe in such nonsense.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him\r\n      away from a place which has always been fatal to his family. The\r\n      world is wide. Why should he wish to live at the place of\r\n      danger?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause it _is_ the place of danger. That is Sir Henry\u2019s nature.\r\n      I fear that unless you can give me some more definite information\r\n      than this it would be impossible to get him to move.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything\r\n      definite.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant\r\n      no more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not\r\n      wish your brother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to\r\n      which he, or anyone else, could object.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he\r\n      thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He\r\n      would be very angry if he knew that I have said anything which\r\n      might induce Sir Henry to go away. But I have done my duty now\r\n      and I will say no more. I must go back, or he will miss me and\r\n      suspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!\u201d She turned and had\r\n      disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders, while\r\n      I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to\r\n      Baskerville Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8.\r\nFirst Report of Dr. Watson\r\n\r\n\r\n      From this point onward I will follow the course of events by\r\n      transcribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie\r\n      before me on the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they\r\n      are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the\r\n      moment more accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these\r\n      tragic events, can possibly do.\r\n\r\n      Baskerville Hall, October 13th.\r\n\r\n      MY DEAR HOLMES,\r\n\r\n      My previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to\r\n      date as to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken corner\r\n      of the world. The longer one stays here the more does the spirit\r\n      of the moor sink into one\u2019s soul, its vastness, and also its grim\r\n      charm. When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all\r\n      traces of modern England behind you, but, on the other hand, you\r\n      are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the\r\n      prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are the\r\n      houses of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge\r\n      monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples. As you\r\n      look at their grey stone huts against the scarred hillsides you\r\n      leave your own age behind you, and if you were to see a\r\n      skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a\r\n      flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you would feel\r\n      that his presence there was more natural than your own. The\r\n      strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what\r\n      must always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian,\r\n      but I could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried\r\n      race who were forced to accept that which none other would\r\n      occupy.\r\n\r\n      All this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me\r\n      and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely\r\n      practical mind. I can still remember your complete indifference\r\n      as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round\r\n      the sun. Let me, therefore, return to the facts concerning Sir\r\n      Henry Baskerville.\r\n\r\n      If you have not had any report within the last few days it is\r\n      because up to today there was nothing of importance to relate.\r\n      Then a very surprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell\r\n      you in due course. But, first of all, I must keep you in touch\r\n      with some of the other factors in the situation.\r\n\r\n      One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped\r\n      convict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that\r\n      he has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the\r\n      lonely householders of this district. A fortnight has passed\r\n      since his flight, during which he has not been seen and nothing\r\n      has been heard of him. It is surely inconceivable that he could\r\n      have held out upon the moor during all that time. Of course, so\r\n      far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all. Any\r\n      one of these stone huts would give him a hiding-place. But there\r\n      is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of\r\n      the moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has gone, and the\r\n      outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.\r\n\r\n      We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could\r\n      take good care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy\r\n      moments when I have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles\r\n      from any help. There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister,\r\n      and the brother, the latter not a very strong man. They would be\r\n      helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this Notting\r\n      Hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance. Both Sir Henry\r\n      and I were concerned at their situation, and it was suggested\r\n      that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there, but\r\n      Stapleton would not hear of it.\r\n\r\n      The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a\r\n      considerable interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to be\r\n      wondered at, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an\r\n      active man like him, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful\r\n      woman. There is something tropical and exotic about her which\r\n      forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother.\r\n      Yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires. He has certainly a\r\n      very marked influence over her, for I have seen her continually\r\n      glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what\r\n      she said. I trust that he is kind to her. There is a dry glitter\r\n      in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips, which goes with a\r\n      positive and possibly a harsh nature. You would find him an\r\n      interesting study.\r\n\r\n      He came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the\r\n      very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the\r\n      legend of the wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. It\r\n      was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which\r\n      is so dismal that it might have suggested the story. We found a\r\n      short valley between rugged tors which led to an open, grassy\r\n      space flecked over with the white cotton grass. In the middle of\r\n      it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at the upper end\r\n      until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous\r\n      beast. In every way it corresponded with the scene of the old\r\n      tragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more\r\n      than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the\r\n      interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men. He spoke\r\n      lightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest.\r\n      Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see that\r\n      he said less than he might, and that he would not express his\r\n      whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the\r\n      baronet. He told us of similar cases, where families had suffered\r\n      from some evil influence, and he left us with the impression that\r\n      he shared the popular view upon the matter.\r\n\r\n      On our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was\r\n      there that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton.\r\n      From the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly\r\n      attracted by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not\r\n      mutual. He referred to her again and again on our walk home, and\r\n      since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen\r\n      something of the brother and sister. They dine here tonight, and\r\n      there is some talk of our going to them next week. One would\r\n      imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and\r\n      yet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest\r\n      disapprobation in his face when Sir Henry has been paying some\r\n      attention to his sister. He is much attached to her, no doubt,\r\n      and would lead a lonely life without her, but it would seem the\r\n      height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her\r\n      making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain that he does not\r\n      wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have several times\r\n      observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being\r\n      _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_. By the way, your instructions to me never to allow\r\n      Sir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a\r\n      love affair were to be added to our other difficulties. My\r\n      popularity would soon suffer if I were to carry out your orders\r\n      to the letter.\r\n\r\n      The other day\u2014Thursday, to be more exact\u2014Dr. Mortimer lunched\r\n      with us. He has been excavating a barrow at Long Down and has got\r\n      a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy. Never was\r\n      there such a single-minded enthusiast as he! The Stapletons came\r\n      in afterwards, and the good doctor took us all to the yew alley\r\n      at Sir Henry\u2019s request to show us exactly how everything occurred\r\n      upon that fatal night. It is a long, dismal walk, the yew alley,\r\n      between two high walls of clipped hedge, with a narrow band of\r\n      grass upon either side. At the far end is an old tumble-down\r\n      summer-house. Halfway down is the moor-gate, where the old\r\n      gentleman left his cigar-ash. It is a white wooden gate with a\r\n      latch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I remembered your theory of\r\n      the affair and tried to picture all that had occurred. As the old\r\n      man stood there he saw something coming across the moor,\r\n      something which terrified him so that he lost his wits and ran\r\n      and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion. There was\r\n      the long, gloomy tunnel down which he fled. And from what? A\r\n      sheep-dog of the moor? Or a spectral hound, black, silent, and\r\n      monstrous? Was there a human agency in the matter? Did the pale,\r\n      watchful Barrymore know more than he cared to say? It was all dim\r\n      and vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind\r\n      it.\r\n\r\n      One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr.\r\n      Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south\r\n      of us. He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and\r\n      choleric. His passion is for the British law, and he has spent a\r\n      large fortune in litigation. He fights for the mere pleasure of\r\n      fighting and is equally ready to take up either side of a\r\n      question, so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly\r\n      amusement. Sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the\r\n      parish to make him open it. At others he will with his own hands\r\n      tear down some other man\u2019s gate and declare that a path has\r\n      existed there from time immemorial, defying the owner to\r\n      prosecute him for trespass. He is learned in old manorial and\r\n      communal rights, and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour\r\n      of the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against them, so\r\n      that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the\r\n      village street or else burned in effigy, according to his latest\r\n      exploit. He is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands\r\n      at present, which will probably swallow up the remainder of his\r\n      fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the\r\n      future. Apart from the law he seems a kindly, good-natured\r\n      person, and I only mention him because you were particular that I\r\n      should send some description of the people who surround us. He is\r\n      curiously employed at present, for, being an amateur astronomer,\r\n      he has an excellent telescope, with which he lies upon the roof\r\n      of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of\r\n      catching a glimpse of the escaped convict. If he would confine\r\n      his energies to this all would be well, but there are rumours\r\n      that he intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer for opening a grave\r\n      without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the\r\n      Neolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down. He helps to keep our\r\n      lives from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where\r\n      it is badly needed.\r\n\r\n      And now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict,\r\n      the Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let\r\n      me end on that which is most important and tell you more about\r\n      the Barrymores, and especially about the surprising development\r\n      of last night.\r\n\r\n      First of all about the test telegram, which you sent from London\r\n      in order to make sure that Barrymore was really here. I have\r\n      already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that\r\n      the test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the\r\n      other. I told Sir Henry how the matter stood, and he at once, in\r\n      his downright fashion, had Barrymore up and asked him whether he\r\n      had received the telegram himself. Barrymore said that he had.\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid the boy deliver it into your own hands?\u201d asked Sir Henry.\r\n\r\n      Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d said he, \u201cI was in the box-room at the time, and my wife\r\n      brought it up to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid you answer it yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write\r\n      it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      In the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI could not quite understand the object of your questions this\r\n      morning, Sir Henry,\u201d said he. \u201cI trust that they do not mean that\r\n      I have done anything to forfeit your confidence?\u201d\r\n\r\n      Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by\r\n      giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London\r\n      outfit having now all arrived.\r\n\r\n      Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solid\r\n      person, very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be\r\n      puritanical. You could hardly conceive a less emotional subject.\r\n      Yet I have told you how, on the first night here, I heard her\r\n      sobbing bitterly, and since then I have more than once observed\r\n      traces of tears upon her face. Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her\r\n      heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts\r\n      her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a domestic\r\n      tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular and\r\n      questionable in this man\u2019s character, but the adventure of last\r\n      night brings all my suspicions to a head.\r\n\r\n      And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that\r\n      I am not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in\r\n      this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night,\r\n      about two in the morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step\r\n      passing my room. I rose, opened my door, and peeped out. A long\r\n      black shadow was trailing down the corridor. It was thrown by a\r\n      man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his\r\n      hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no covering to his feet.\r\n      I could merely see the outline, but his height told me that it\r\n      was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly, and there\r\n      was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole\r\n      appearance.\r\n\r\n      I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which\r\n      runs round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther\r\n      side. I waited until he had passed out of sight and then I\r\n      followed him. When I came round the balcony he had reached the\r\n      end of the farther corridor, and I could see from the glimmer of\r\n      light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms.\r\n      Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his\r\n      expedition became more mysterious than ever. The light shone\r\n      steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down the\r\n      passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of\r\n      the door.\r\n\r\n      Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held\r\n      against the glass. His profile was half turned towards me, and\r\n      his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out\r\n      into the blackness of the moor. For some minutes he stood\r\n      watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan and with an\r\n      impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my way\r\n      back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing\r\n      once more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had\r\n      fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock,\r\n      but I could not tell whence the sound came. What it all means I\r\n      cannot guess, but there is some secret business going on in this\r\n      house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom\r\n      of. I do not trouble you with my theories, for you asked me to\r\n      furnish you only with facts. I have had a long talk with Sir\r\n      Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of campaign founded\r\n      upon my observations of last night. I will not speak about it\r\n      just now, but it should make my next report interesting reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9.\r\nThe Light upon the Moor [Second Report of Dr. Watson]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th.\r\n\r\n      MY DEAR HOLMES,\r\n\r\n      If I was compelled to leave you without much news during the\r\n      early days of my mission you must acknowledge that I am making up\r\n      for lost time, and that events are now crowding thick and fast\r\n      upon us. In my last report I ended upon my top note with\r\n      Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget already\r\n      which will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you.\r\n      Things have taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. In\r\n      some ways they have within the last forty-eight hours become much\r\n      clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated. But I\r\n      will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself.\r\n\r\n      Before breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went\r\n      down the corridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had\r\n      been on the night before. The western window through which he had\r\n      stared so intently has, I noticed, one peculiarity above all\r\n      other windows in the house\u2014it commands the nearest outlook on to\r\n      the moor. There is an opening between two trees which enables one\r\n      from this point of view to look right down upon it, while from\r\n      all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be\r\n      obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since only this\r\n      window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for\r\n      something or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so\r\n      that I can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone.\r\n      It had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was\r\n      on foot. That would have accounted for his stealthy movements and\r\n      also for the uneasiness of his wife. The man is a\r\n      striking-looking fellow, very well equipped to steal the heart of\r\n      a country girl, so that this theory seemed to have something to\r\n      support it. That opening of the door which I had heard after I\r\n      had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep\r\n      some clandestine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in the\r\n      morning, and I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however\r\n      much the result may have shown that they were unfounded.\r\n\r\n      But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore\u2019s movements might\r\n      be, I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself\r\n      until I could explain them was more than I could bear. I had an\r\n      interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast, and I\r\n      told him all that I had seen. He was less surprised than I had\r\n      expected.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind to\r\n      speak to him about it,\u201d said he. \u201cTwo or three times I have heard\r\n      his steps in the passage, coming and going, just about the hour\r\n      you name.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular\r\n      window,\u201d I suggested.\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him and see\r\n      what it is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes\r\n      would do if he were here.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,\u201d said\r\n      I. \u201cHe would follow Barrymore and see what he did.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen we shall do it together.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut surely he would hear us.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance\r\n      of that. We\u2019ll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he\r\n      passes.\u201d Sir Henry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was\r\n      evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat\r\n      quiet life upon the moor.\r\n\r\n      The baronet has been in communication with the architect who\r\n      prepared the plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from\r\n      London, so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon.\r\n      There have been decorators and furnishers up from Plymouth, and\r\n      it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spare\r\n      no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family. When\r\n      the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he will need\r\n      will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves there are\r\n      pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is\r\n      willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a\r\n      woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton.\r\n      And yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as\r\n      one would under the circumstances expect. Today, for example, its\r\n      surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple, which has caused\r\n      our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance.\r\n\r\n      After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir\r\n      Henry put on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of\r\n      course I did the same.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat, are _you_ coming, Watson?\u201d he asked, looking at me in a\r\n      curious way.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat depends on whether you are going on the moor,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude,\r\n      but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not\r\n      leave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon the\r\n      moor.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d said he, \u201cHolmes, with all his wisdom, did not\r\n      foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the\r\n      moor. You understand me? I am sure that you are the last man in\r\n      the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out\r\n      alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n      It put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to say\r\n      or what to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his\r\n      cane and was gone.\r\n\r\n      But when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached\r\n      me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my\r\n      sight. I imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to\r\n      you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my\r\n      disregard for your instructions. I assure you my cheeks flushed\r\n      at the very thought. It might not even now be too late to\r\n      overtake him, so I set off at once in the direction of Merripit\r\n      House.\r\n\r\n      I hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing\r\n      anything of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor\r\n      path branches off. There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the\r\n      wrong direction after all, I mounted a hill from which I could\r\n      command a view\u2014the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry.\r\n      Thence I saw him at once. He was on the moor path about a quarter\r\n      of a mile off, and a lady was by his side who could only be Miss\r\n      Stapleton. It was clear that there was already an understanding\r\n      between them and that they had met by appointment. They were\r\n      walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her making\r\n      quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest\r\n      in what she was saying, while he listened intently, and once or\r\n      twice shook his head in strong dissent. I stood among the rocks\r\n      watching them, very much puzzled as to what I should do next. To\r\n      follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to\r\n      be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to\r\n      let him out of my sight. To act the spy upon a friend was a\r\n      hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to observe\r\n      him from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to\r\n      him afterwards what I had done. It is true that if any sudden\r\n      danger had threatened him I was too far away to be of use, and\r\n      yet I am sure that you will agree with me that the position was\r\n      very difficult, and that there was nothing more which I could do.\r\n\r\n      Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and\r\n      were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was\r\n      suddenly aware that I was not the only witness of their\r\n      interview. A wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye, and\r\n      another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man\r\n      who was moving among the broken ground. It was Stapleton with his\r\n      butterfly-net. He was very much closer to the pair than I was,\r\n      and he appeared to be moving in their direction. At this instant\r\n      Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side. His arm was\r\n      round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from\r\n      him with her face averted. He stooped his head to hers, and she\r\n      raised one hand as if in protest. Next moment I saw them spring\r\n      apart and turn hurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of the\r\n      interruption. He was running wildly towards them, his absurd net\r\n      dangling behind him. He gesticulated and almost danced with\r\n      excitement in front of the lovers. What the scene meant I could\r\n      not imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton was abusing Sir\r\n      Henry, who offered explanations, which became more angry as the\r\n      other refused to accept them. The lady stood by in haughty\r\n      silence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a\r\n      peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at\r\n      Sir Henry, walked off by the side of her brother. The\r\n      naturalist\u2019s angry gestures showed that the lady was included in\r\n      his displeasure. The baronet stood for a minute looking after\r\n      them, and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come,\r\n      his head hanging, the very picture of dejection.\r\n\r\n      What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed\r\n      to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend\u2019s\r\n      knowledge. I ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at\r\n      the bottom. His face was flushed with anger and his brows were\r\n      wrinkled, like one who is at his wit\u2019s ends what to do.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHalloa, Watson! Where have you dropped from?\u201d said he. \u201cYou\r\n      don\u2019t mean to say that you came after me in spite of all?\u201d\r\n\r\n      I explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to\r\n      remain behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed\r\n      all that had occurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but\r\n      my frankness disarmed his anger, and he broke at last into a\r\n      rather rueful laugh.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe\r\n      place for a man to be private,\u201d said he, \u201cbut, by thunder, the\r\n      whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my\r\n      wooing\u2014and a mighty poor wooing at that! Where had you engaged a\r\n      seat?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was on that hill.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cQuite in the back row, eh? But her brother was well up to the\r\n      front. Did you see him come out on us?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, I did.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid he ever strike you as being crazy\u2014this brother of hers?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI can\u2019t say that he ever did.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until today,\r\n      but you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a\r\n      straitjacket. What\u2019s the matter with me, anyhow? You\u2019ve lived\r\n      near me for some weeks, Watson. Tell me straight, now! Is there\r\n      anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a\r\n      woman that I loved?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI should say not.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe can\u2019t object to my worldly position, so it must be myself\r\n      that he has this down on. What has he against me? I never hurt\r\n      man or woman in my life that I know of. And yet he would not so\r\n      much as let me touch the tips of her fingers.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid he say so?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I\u2019ve only known her\r\n      these few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made\r\n      for me, and she, too\u2014she was happy when she was with me, and that\r\n      I\u2019ll swear. There\u2019s a light in a woman\u2019s eyes that speaks louder\r\n      than words. But he has never let us get together and it was only\r\n      today for the first time that I saw a chance of having a few\r\n      words with her alone. She was glad to meet me, but when she did\r\n      it was not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn\u2019t have\r\n      let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it. She\r\n      kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and that\r\n      she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that\r\n      since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if\r\n      she really wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her\r\n      to arrange to go with me. With that I offered in as many words to\r\n      marry her, but before she could answer, down came this brother of\r\n      hers, running at us with a face on him like a madman. He was just\r\n      white with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with\r\n      fury. What was I doing with the lady? How dared I offer her\r\n      attentions which were distasteful to her? Did I think that\r\n      because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he had not\r\n      been her brother I should have known better how to answer him. As\r\n      it was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were such\r\n      as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour\r\n      me by becoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better,\r\n      so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more\r\n      hotly than I should perhaps, considering that she was standing\r\n      by. So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here\r\n      am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. Just tell me\r\n      what it all means, Watson, and I\u2019ll owe you more than ever I can\r\n      hope to pay.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely\r\n      puzzled myself. Our friend\u2019s title, his fortune, his age, his\r\n      character, and his appearance are all in his favour, and I know\r\n      nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his\r\n      family. That his advances should be rejected so brusquely without\r\n      any reference to the lady\u2019s own wishes and that the lady should\r\n      accept the situation without protest is very amazing. However,\r\n      our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from Stapleton\r\n      himself that very afternoon. He had come to offer apologies for\r\n      his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview\r\n      with Sir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was\r\n      that the breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at\r\n      Merripit House next Friday as a sign of it.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t say now that he isn\u2019t a crazy man,\u201d said Sir Henry; \u201cI\r\n      can\u2019t forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning,\r\n      but I must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology\r\n      than he has done.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid he give any explanation of his conduct?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHis sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural\r\n      enough, and I am glad that he should understand her value. They\r\n      have always been together, and according to his account he has\r\n      been a very lonely man with only her as a companion, so that the\r\n      thought of losing her was really terrible to him. He had not\r\n      understood, he said, that I was becoming attached to her, but\r\n      when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so, and that she\r\n      might be taken away from him, it gave him such a shock that for a\r\n      time he was not responsible for what he said or did. He was very\r\n      sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish and\r\n      how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a\r\n      beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. If\r\n      she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like\r\n      myself than to anyone else. But in any case it was a blow to him\r\n      and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself\r\n      to meet it. He would withdraw all opposition upon his part if I\r\n      would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be\r\n      content with cultivating the lady\u2019s friendship during that time\r\n      without claiming her love. This I promised, and so the matter\r\n      rests.\u201d\r\n\r\n      So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is\r\n      something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we\r\n      are floundering. We know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour\r\n      upon his sister\u2019s suitor\u2014even when that suitor was so eligible a\r\n      one as Sir Henry. And now I pass on to another thread which I\r\n      have extricated out of the tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs\r\n      in the night, of the tear-stained face of Mrs. Barrymore, of the\r\n      secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window.\r\n      Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me that I have not\r\n      disappointed you as an agent\u2014that you do not regret the\r\n      confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down. All\r\n      these things have by one night\u2019s work been thoroughly cleared.\r\n\r\n      I have said \u201cby one night\u2019s work,\u201d but, in truth, it was by two\r\n      nights\u2019 work, for on the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up\r\n      with Sir Henry in his rooms until nearly three o\u2019clock in the\r\n      morning, but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming\r\n      clock upon the stairs. It was a most melancholy vigil and ended\r\n      by each of us falling asleep in our chairs. Fortunately we were\r\n      not discouraged, and we determined to try again. The next night\r\n      we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making the\r\n      least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by,\r\n      and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient\r\n      interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into\r\n      which he hopes the game may wander. One struck, and two, and we\r\n      had almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an\r\n      instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary\r\n      senses keenly on the alert once more. We had heard the creak of a\r\n      step in the passage.\r\n\r\n      Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the\r\n      distance. Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out\r\n      in pursuit. Already our man had gone round the gallery and the\r\n      corridor was all in darkness. Softly we stole along until we had\r\n      come into the other wing. We were just in time to catch a glimpse\r\n      of the tall, black-bearded figure, his shoulders rounded as he\r\n      tiptoed down the passage. Then he passed through the same door as\r\n      before, and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and\r\n      shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor. We\r\n      shuffled cautiously towards it, trying every plank before we\r\n      dared to put our whole weight upon it. We had taken the\r\n      precaution of leaving our boots behind us, but, even so, the old\r\n      boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread. Sometimes it seemed\r\n      impossible that he should fail to hear our approach. However, the\r\n      man is fortunately rather deaf, and he was entirely preoccupied\r\n      in that which he was doing. When at last we reached the door and\r\n      peeped through we found him crouching at the window, candle in\r\n      hand, his white, intent face pressed against the pane, exactly as\r\n      I had seen him two nights before.\r\n\r\n      We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man to\r\n      whom the most direct way is always the most natural. He walked\r\n      into the room, and as he did so Barrymore sprang up from the\r\n      window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood, livid and\r\n      trembling, before us. His dark eyes, glaring out of the white\r\n      mask of his face, were full of horror and astonishment as he\r\n      gazed from Sir Henry to me.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat are you doing here, Barrymore?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing, sir.\u201d His agitation was so great that he could hardly\r\n      speak, and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his\r\n      candle. \u201cIt was the window, sir. I go round at night to see that\r\n      they are fastened.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn the second floor?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir, all the windows.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cLook here, Barrymore,\u201d said Sir Henry sternly, \u201cwe have made up\r\n      our minds to have the truth out of you, so it will save you\r\n      trouble to tell it sooner rather than later. Come, now! No lies!\r\n      What were you doing at that window?\u201d\r\n\r\n      The fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his hands\r\n      together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and\r\n      misery.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle to the window.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd why were you holding a candle to the window?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t ask me, Sir Henry\u2014don\u2019t ask me! I give you my word, sir,\r\n      that it is not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. If it\r\n      concerned no one but myself I would not try to keep it from you.\u201d\r\n\r\n      A sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle from the\r\n      trembling hand of the butler.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe must have been holding it as a signal,\u201d said I. \u201cLet us see\r\n      if there is any answer.\u201d I held it as he had done, and stared out\r\n      into the darkness of the night. Vaguely I could discern the black\r\n      bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the\r\n      moon was behind the clouds. And then I gave a cry of exultation,\r\n      for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the\r\n      dark veil, and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square\r\n      framed by the window.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere it is!\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no, sir, it is nothing\u2014nothing at all!\u201d the butler broke in;\r\n      \u201cI assure you, sir\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMove your light across the window, Watson!\u201d cried the baronet.\r\n      \u201cSee, the other moves also! Now, you rascal, do you deny that it\r\n      is a signal? Come, speak up! Who is your confederate out yonder,\r\n      and what is this conspiracy that is going on?\u201d\r\n\r\n      The man\u2019s face became openly defiant. \u201cIt is my business, and not\r\n      yours. I will not tell.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you leave my employment right away.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery good, sir. If I must I must.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you go in disgrace. By thunder, you may well be ashamed of\r\n      yourself. Your family has lived with mine for over a hundred\r\n      years under this roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plot\r\n      against me.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no, sir; no, not against you!\u201d It was a woman\u2019s voice, and\r\n      Mrs. Barrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her husband,\r\n      was standing at the door. Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt\r\n      might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling\r\n      upon her face.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe have to go, Eliza. This is the end of it. You can pack our\r\n      things,\u201d said the butler.\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, John, John, have I brought you to this? It is my doing, Sir\r\n      Henry\u2014all mine. He has done nothing except for my sake and\r\n      because I asked him.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSpeak out, then! What does it mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy unhappy brother is starving on the moor. We cannot let him\r\n      perish at our very gates. The light is a signal to him that food\r\n      is ready for him, and his light out yonder is to show the spot to\r\n      which to bring it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen your brother is\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe escaped convict, sir\u2014Selden, the criminal.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s the truth, sir,\u201d said Barrymore. \u201cI said that it was not\r\n      my secret and that I could not tell it to you. But now you have\r\n      heard it, and you will see that if there was a plot it was not\r\n      against you.\u201d\r\n\r\n      This, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at\r\n      night and the light at the window. Sir Henry and I both stared at\r\n      the woman in amazement. Was it possible that this stolidly\r\n      respectable person was of the same blood as one of the most\r\n      notorious criminals in the country?\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother. We\r\n      humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way\r\n      in everything until he came to think that the world was made for\r\n      his pleasure, and that he could do what he liked in it. Then as\r\n      he grew older he met wicked companions, and the devil entered\r\n      into him until he broke my mother\u2019s heart and dragged our name in\r\n      the dirt. From crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is\r\n      only the mercy of God which has snatched him from the scaffold;\r\n      but to me, sir, he was always the little curly-headed boy that I\r\n      had nursed and played with as an elder sister would. That was why\r\n      he broke prison, sir. He knew that I was here and that we could\r\n      not refuse to help him. When he dragged himself here one night,\r\n      weary and starving, with the warders hard at his heels, what\r\n      could we do? We took him in and fed him and cared for him. Then\r\n      you returned, sir, and my brother thought he would be safer on\r\n      the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so he\r\n      lay in hiding there. But every second night we made sure if he\r\n      was still there by putting a light in the window, and if there\r\n      was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him.\r\n      Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long as he was there\r\n      we could not desert him. That is the whole truth, as I am an\r\n      honest Christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in\r\n      the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me, for whose\r\n      sake he has done all that he has.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The woman\u2019s words came with an intense earnestness which carried\r\n      conviction with them.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs this true, Barrymore?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. Forget\r\n      what I have said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk\r\n      further about this matter in the morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n      When they were gone we looked out of the window again. Sir Henry\r\n      had flung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our\r\n      faces. Far away in the black distance there still glowed that one\r\n      tiny point of yellow light.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI wonder he dares,\u201d said Sir Henry.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt may be so placed as to be only visible from here.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery likely. How far do you think it is?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOut by the Cleft Tor, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot more than a mile or two off.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHardly that.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to\r\n      it. And he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. By\r\n      thunder, Watson, I am going out to take that man!\u201d\r\n\r\n      The same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if the\r\n      Barrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret had\r\n      been forced from them. The man was a danger to the community, an\r\n      unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse.\r\n      We were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him\r\n      back where he could do no harm. With his brutal and violent\r\n      nature, others would have to pay the price if we held our hands.\r\n      Any night, for example, our neighbours the Stapletons might be\r\n      attacked by him, and it may have been the thought of this which\r\n      made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will come,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen get your revolver and put on your boots. The sooner we\r\n      start the better, as the fellow may put out his light and be\r\n      off.\u201d\r\n\r\n      In five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our\r\n      expedition. We hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull\r\n      moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves.\r\n      The night air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay. Now and\r\n      again the moon peeped out for an instant, but clouds were driving\r\n      over the face of the sky, and just as we came out on the moor a\r\n      thin rain began to fall. The light still burned steadily in\r\n      front.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you armed?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have a hunting-crop.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a\r\n      desperate fellow. We shall take him by surprise and have him at\r\n      our mercy before he can resist.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI say, Watson,\u201d said the baronet, \u201cwhat would Holmes say to\r\n      this? How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil\r\n      is exalted?\u201d\r\n\r\n      As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast\r\n      gloom of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon\r\n      the borders of the great Grimpen Mire. It came with the wind\r\n      through the silence of the night, a long, deep mutter, then a\r\n      rising howl, and then the sad moan in which it died away. Again\r\n      and again it sounded, the whole air throbbing with it, strident,\r\n      wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my sleeve and his face\r\n      glimmered white through the darkness.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy God, what\u2019s that, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a sound they have on the moor. I heard it\r\n      once before.\u201d\r\n\r\n      It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stood\r\n      straining our ears, but nothing came.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWatson,\u201d said the baronet, \u201cit was the cry of a hound.\u201d\r\n\r\n      My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice\r\n      which told of the sudden horror which had seized him.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do they call this sound?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe folk on the countryside.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, they are ignorant people. Why should you mind what they call\r\n      it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cTell me, Watson. What do they say of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      I hesitated but could not escape the question.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles.\u201d\r\n\r\n      He groaned and was silent for a few moments.\r\n\r\n      \u201cA hound it was,\u201d he said at last, \u201cbut it seemed to come from\r\n      miles away, over yonder, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was hard to say whence it came.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt rose and fell with the wind. Isn\u2019t that the direction of the\r\n      great Grimpen Mire?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, it was up there. Come now, Watson, didn\u2019t you think\r\n      yourself that it was the cry of a hound? I am not a child. You\r\n      need not fear to speak the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cStapleton was with me when I heard it last. He said that it\r\n      might be the calling of a strange bird.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be some truth in all\r\n      these stories? Is it possible that I am really in danger from so\r\n      dark a cause? You don\u2019t believe it, do you, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London, and it is\r\n      another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear\r\n      such a cry as that. And my uncle! There was the footprint of the\r\n      hound beside him as he lay. It all fits together. I don\u2019t think\r\n      that I am a coward, Watson, but that sound seemed to freeze my\r\n      very blood. Feel my hand!\u201d\r\n\r\n      It was as cold as a block of marble.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ll be all right tomorrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get that cry out of my head. What do you\r\n      advise that we do now?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cShall we turn back?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will do\r\n      it. We after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not,\r\n      after us. Come on! We\u2019ll see it through if all the fiends of the\r\n      pit were loose upon the moor.\u201d\r\n\r\n      We stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of\r\n      the craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning\r\n      steadily in front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance\r\n      of a light upon a pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer\r\n      seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might\r\n      have been within a few yards of us. But at last we could see\r\n      whence it came, and then we knew that we were indeed very close.\r\n      A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which\r\n      flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also\r\n      to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of\r\n      Baskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed our approach,\r\n      and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light. It\r\n      was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle\r\n      of the moor, with no sign of life near it\u2014just the one straight\r\n      yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat shall we do now?\u201d whispered Sir Henry.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can get a\r\n      glimpse of him.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him. Over\r\n      the rocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was\r\n      thrust out an evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all\r\n      seamed and scored with vile passions. Foul with mire, with a\r\n      bristling beard, and hung with matted hair, it might well have\r\n      belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on\r\n      the hillsides. The light beneath him was reflected in his small,\r\n      cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the\r\n      darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps\r\n      of the hunters.\r\n\r\n      Something had evidently aroused his suspicions. It may have been\r\n      that Barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to\r\n      give, or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking\r\n      that all was not well, but I could read his fears upon his wicked\r\n      face. Any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the\r\n      darkness. I sprang forward therefore, and Sir Henry did the same.\r\n      At the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us and\r\n      hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which had\r\n      sheltered us. I caught one glimpse of his short, squat, strongly\r\n      built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run. At the\r\n      same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds.\r\n      We rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our man\r\n      running with great speed down the other side, springing over the\r\n      stones in his way with the activity of a mountain goat. A lucky\r\n      long shot of my revolver might have crippled him, but I had\r\n      brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an\r\n      unarmed man who was running away.\r\n\r\n      We were both swift runners and in fairly good training, but we\r\n      soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him. We saw him\r\n      for a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small speck\r\n      moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distant\r\n      hill. We ran and ran until we were completely blown, but the\r\n      space between us grew ever wider. Finally we stopped and sat\r\n      panting on two rocks, while we watched him disappearing in the\r\n      distance.\r\n\r\n      And it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and\r\n      unexpected thing. We had risen from our rocks and were turning to\r\n      go home, having abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was low\r\n      upon the right, and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up\r\n      against the lower curve of its silver disc. There, outlined as\r\n      black as an ebony statue on that shining background, I saw the\r\n      figure of a man upon the tor. Do not think that it was a\r\n      delusion, Holmes. I assure you that I have never in my life seen\r\n      anything more clearly. As far as I could judge, the figure was\r\n      that of a tall, thin man. He stood with his legs a little\r\n      separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he were\r\n      brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which\r\n      lay before him. He might have been the very spirit of that\r\n      terrible place. It was not the convict. This man was far from the\r\n      place where the latter had disappeared. Besides, he was a much\r\n      taller man. With a cry of surprise I pointed him out to the\r\n      baronet, but in the instant during which I had turned to grasp\r\n      his arm the man was gone. There was the sharp pinnacle of granite\r\n      still cutting the lower edge of the moon, but its peak bore no\r\n      trace of that silent and motionless figure.\r\n\r\n      I wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but it\r\n      was some distance away. The baronet\u2019s nerves were still quivering\r\n      from that cry, which recalled the dark story of his family, and\r\n      he was not in the mood for fresh adventures. He had not seen this\r\n      lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his\r\n      strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me. \u201cA\r\n      warder, no doubt,\u201d said he. \u201cThe moor has been thick with them\r\n      since this fellow escaped.\u201d Well, perhaps his explanation may be\r\n      the right one, but I should like to have some further proof of\r\n      it. Today we mean to communicate to the Princetown people where\r\n      they should look for their missing man, but it is hard lines that\r\n      we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our\r\n      own prisoner. Such are the adventures of last night, and you must\r\n      acknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have done you very well in\r\n      the matter of a report. Much of what I tell you is no doubt quite\r\n      irrelevant, but still I feel that it is best that I should let\r\n      you have all the facts and leave you to select for yourself those\r\n      which will be of most service to you in helping you to your\r\n      conclusions. We are certainly making some progress. So far as the\r\n      Barrymores go we have found the motive of their actions, and that\r\n      has cleared up the situation very much. But the moor with its\r\n      mysteries and its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as\r\n      ever. Perhaps in my next I may be able to throw some light upon\r\n      this also. Best of all would it be if you could come down to us.\r\n      In any case you will hear from me again in the course of the next\r\n      few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10.\r\nExtract from the Diary of Dr. Watson\r\n\r\n\r\n      So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have\r\n      forwarded during these early days to Sherlock Holmes. Now,\r\n      however, I have arrived at a point in my narrative where I am\r\n      compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to my\r\n      recollections, aided by the diary which I kept at the time. A few\r\n      extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which\r\n      are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. I proceed,\r\n      then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the\r\n      convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.\r\n\r\n      _October_ 16_th_.\u2014A dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain.\r\n      The house is banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and\r\n      then to show the dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver\r\n      veins upon the sides of the hills, and the distant boulders\r\n      gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces. It is\r\n      melancholy outside and in. The baronet is in a black reaction\r\n      after the excitements of the night. I am conscious myself of a\r\n      weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger\u2014ever present\r\n      danger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define\r\n      it.\r\n\r\n      And have I not cause for such a feeling? Consider the long\r\n      sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister\r\n      influence which is at work around us. There is the death of the\r\n      last occupant of the Hall, fulfilling so exactly the conditions\r\n      of the family legend, and there are the repeated reports from\r\n      peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor.\r\n      Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound which resembled the\r\n      distant baying of a hound. It is incredible, impossible, that it\r\n      should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature. A spectral\r\n      hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its\r\n      howling is surely not to be thought of. Stapleton may fall in\r\n      with such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one\r\n      quality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade\r\n      me to believe in such a thing. To do so would be to descend to\r\n      the level of these poor peasants, who are not content with a mere\r\n      fiend dog but must needs describe him with hell-fire shooting\r\n      from his mouth and eyes. Holmes would not listen to such fancies,\r\n      and I am his agent. But facts are facts, and I have twice heard\r\n      this crying upon the moor. Suppose that there were really some\r\n      huge hound loose upon it; that would go far to explain\r\n      everything. But where could such a hound lie concealed, where did\r\n      it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one\r\n      saw it by day? It must be confessed that the natural explanation\r\n      offers almost as many difficulties as the other. And always,\r\n      apart from the hound, there is the fact of the human agency in\r\n      London, the man in the cab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry\r\n      against the moor. This at least was real, but it might have been\r\n      the work of a protecting friend as easily as of an enemy. Where\r\n      is that friend or enemy now? Has he remained in London, or has he\r\n      followed us down here? Could he\u2014could he be the stranger whom I\r\n      saw upon the tor?\r\n\r\n      It is true that I have had only the one glance at him, and yet\r\n      there are some things to which I am ready to swear. He is no one\r\n      whom I have seen down here, and I have now met all the\r\n      neighbours. The figure was far taller than that of Stapleton, far\r\n      thinner than that of Frankland. Barrymore it might possibly have\r\n      been, but we had left him behind us, and I am certain that he\r\n      could not have followed us. A stranger then is still dogging us,\r\n      just as a stranger dogged us in London. We have never shaken him\r\n      off. If I could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we might\r\n      find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. To this one\r\n      purpose I must now devote all my energies.\r\n\r\n      My first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. My second\r\n      and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as\r\n      possible to anyone. He is silent and distrait. His nerves have\r\n      been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor. I will say\r\n      nothing to add to his anxieties, but I will take my own steps to\r\n      attain my own end.\r\n\r\n      We had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore\r\n      asked leave to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in\r\n      his study some little time. Sitting in the billiard-room I more\r\n      than once heard the sound of voices raised, and I had a pretty\r\n      good idea what the point was which was under discussion. After a\r\n      time the baronet opened his door and called for me. \u201cBarrymore\r\n      considers that he has a grievance,\u201d he said. \u201cHe thinks that it\r\n      was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down when he,\r\n      of his own free will, had told us the secret.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI may have spoken too warmly, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cand if I have, I\r\n      am sure that I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was very much\r\n      surprised when I heard you two gentlemen come back this morning\r\n      and learned that you had been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has\r\n      enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you had told us of your own free will it would have been a\r\n      different thing,\u201d said the baronet, \u201cyou only told us, or rather\r\n      your wife only told us, when it was forced from you and you could\r\n      not help yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir\r\n      Henry\u2014indeed I didn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scattered\r\n      over the moor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. You\r\n      only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr.\r\n      Stapleton\u2019s house, for example, with no one but himself to defend\r\n      it. There\u2019s no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe\u2019ll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon\r\n      that. But he will never trouble anyone in this country again. I\r\n      assure you, Sir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary\r\n      arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to\r\n      South America. For God\u2019s sake, sir, I beg of you not to let the\r\n      police know that he is still on the moor. They have given up the\r\n      chase there, and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for\r\n      him. You can\u2019t tell on him without getting my wife and me into\r\n      trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you say, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n      I shrugged my shoulders. \u201cIf he were safely out of the country it\r\n      would relieve the tax-payer of a burden.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut how about the chance of his holding someone up before he\r\n      goes?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him with\r\n      all that he can want. To commit a crime would be to show where he\r\n      was hiding.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is true,\u201d said Sir Henry. \u201cWell, Barrymore\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cGod bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! It would have\r\n      killed my poor wife had he been taken again.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But, after\r\n      what we have heard I don\u2019t feel as if I could give the man up, so\r\n      there is an end of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.\u201d\r\n\r\n      With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he\r\n      hesitated and then came back.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ve been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the\r\n      best I can for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, and\r\n      perhaps I should have said it before, but it was long after the\r\n      inquest that I found it out. I\u2019ve never breathed a word about it\r\n      yet to mortal man. It\u2019s about poor Sir Charles\u2019s death.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The baronet and I were both upon our feet. \u201cDo you know how he\r\n      died?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, sir, I don\u2019t know that.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat then?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI know why he was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet a\r\n      woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo meet a woman! He?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the woman\u2019s name?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI can\u2019t give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials.\r\n      Her initials were L. L.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do you know this, Barrymore?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He had\r\n      usually a great many letters, for he was a public man and well\r\n      known for his kind heart, so that everyone who was in trouble was\r\n      glad to turn to him. But that morning, as it chanced, there was\r\n      only this one letter, so I took the more notice of it. It was\r\n      from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed in a woman\u2019s hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have\r\n      done had it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was\r\n      cleaning out Sir Charles\u2019s study\u2014it had never been touched since\r\n      his death\u2014and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back\r\n      of the grate. The greater part of it was charred to pieces, but\r\n      one little slip, the end of a page, hung together, and the\r\n      writing could still be read, though it was grey on a black\r\n      ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the\r\n      letter and it said: \u2018Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn\r\n      this letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath it were\r\n      signed the initials L. L.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you got that slip?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHad Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I should\r\n      not have noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you have no idea who L. L. is?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our\r\n      hands upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles\u2019s\r\n      death.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal this\r\n      important information.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came to\r\n      us. And then again, sir, we were both of us very fond of Sir\r\n      Charles, as we well might be considering all that he has done for\r\n      us. To rake this up couldn\u2019t help our poor master, and it\u2019s well\r\n      to go carefully when there\u2019s a lady in the case. Even the best of\r\n      us\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou thought it might injure his reputation?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, sir, I thought no good could come of it. But now you have\r\n      been kind to us, and I feel as if it would be treating you\r\n      unfairly not to tell you all that I know about the matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery good, Barrymore; you can go.\u201d When the butler had left us\r\n      Sir Henry turned to me. \u201cWell, Watson, what do you think of this\r\n      new light?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up\r\n      the whole business. We have gained that much. We know that there\r\n      is someone who has the facts if we can only find her. What do you\r\n      think we should do?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cLet Holmes know all about it at once. It will give him the clue\r\n      for which he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does not\r\n      bring him down.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning\u2019s\r\n      conversation for Holmes. It was evident to me that he had been\r\n      very busy of late, for the notes which I had from Baker Street\r\n      were few and short, with no comments upon the information which I\r\n      had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission. No doubt his\r\n      blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties. And yet this\r\n      new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his\r\n      interest. I wish that he were here.\r\n\r\n      _October_ 17_th_.\u2014All day today the rain poured down, rustling on\r\n      the ivy and dripping from the eaves. I thought of the convict out\r\n      upon the bleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil! Whatever his\r\n      crimes, he has suffered something to atone for them. And then I\r\n      thought of that other one\u2014the face in the cab, the figure against\r\n      the moon. Was he also out in that deluged\u2014the unseen watcher, the\r\n      man of darkness? In the evening I put on my waterproof and I\r\n      walked far upon the sodden moor, full of dark imaginings, the\r\n      rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears.\r\n      God help those who wander into the great mire now, for even the\r\n      firm uplands are becoming a morass. I found the black tor upon\r\n      which I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its craggy summit\r\n      I looked out myself across the melancholy downs. Rain squalls\r\n      drifted across their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured\r\n      clouds hung low over the landscape, trailing in grey wreaths down\r\n      the sides of the fantastic hills. In the distant hollow on the\r\n      left, half hidden by the mist, the two thin towers of Baskerville\r\n      Hall rose above the trees. They were the only signs of human life\r\n      which I could see, save only those prehistoric huts which lay\r\n      thickly upon the slopes of the hills. Nowhere was there any trace\r\n      of that lonely man whom I had seen on the same spot two nights\r\n      before.\r\n\r\n      As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in his\r\n      dog-cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying\r\n      farmhouse of Foulmire. He has been very attentive to us, and\r\n      hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall to see\r\n      how we were getting on. He insisted upon my climbing into his\r\n      dog-cart, and he gave me a lift homeward. I found him much\r\n      troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel. It had\r\n      wandered on to the moor and had never come back. I gave him such\r\n      consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the Grimpen\r\n      Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBy the way, Mortimer,\u201d said I as we jolted along the rough road,\r\n      \u201cI suppose there are few people living within driving distance of\r\n      this whom you do not know?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHardly any, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cCan you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are\r\n      L. L.?\u201d\r\n\r\n      He thought for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d said he. \u201cThere are a few gipsies and labouring folk for\r\n      whom I can\u2019t answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no\r\n      one whose initials are those. Wait a bit though,\u201d he added after\r\n      a pause. \u201cThere is Laura Lyons\u2014her initials are L. L.\u2014but she\r\n      lives in Coombe Tracey.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho is she?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe is Frankland\u2019s daughter.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat! Old Frankland the crank?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly. She married an artist named Lyons, who came sketching\r\n      on the moor. He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. The\r\n      fault from what I hear may not have been entirely on one side.\r\n      Her father refused to have anything to do with her because she\r\n      had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other\r\n      reasons as well. So, between the old sinner and the young one the\r\n      girl has had a pretty bad time.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow does she live?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be\r\n      more, for his own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever she\r\n      may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the\r\n      bad. Her story got about, and several of the people here did\r\n      something to enable her to earn an honest living. Stapleton did\r\n      for one, and Sir Charles for another. I gave a trifle myself. It\r\n      was to set her up in a typewriting business.\u201d\r\n\r\n      He wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to\r\n      satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much, for there is\r\n      no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence. Tomorrow\r\n      morning I shall find my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see\r\n      this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of equivocal reputation, a long step will\r\n      have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of\r\n      mysteries. I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent,\r\n      for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent\r\n      I asked him casually to what type Frankland\u2019s skull belonged, and\r\n      so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive. I have\r\n      not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.\r\n\r\n      I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous\r\n      and melancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore just\r\n      now, which gives me one more strong card which I can play in due\r\n      time.\r\n\r\n      Mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played\r\n      \u00e9cart\u00e9 afterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into the\r\n      library, and I took the chance to ask him a few questions.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201chas this precious relation of yours departed, or\r\n      is he still lurking out yonder?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he has\r\n      brought nothing but trouble here! I\u2019ve not heard of him since I\r\n      left out food for him last, and that was three days ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid you see him then?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen he was certainly there?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took\r\n      it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at\r\n      Barrymore.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou know that there is another man then?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you seen him?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do you know of him then?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSelden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. He\u2019s in hiding,\r\n      too, but he\u2019s not a convict as far as I can make out. I don\u2019t\r\n      like it, Dr. Watson\u2014I tell you straight, sir, that I don\u2019t like\r\n      it.\u201d He spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this matter\r\n      but that of your master. I have come here with no object except\r\n      to help him. Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don\u2019t like.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst\r\n      or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s all these goings-on, sir,\u201d he cried at last, waving his\r\n      hand towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor.\r\n      \u201cThere\u2019s foul play somewhere, and there\u2019s black villainy brewing,\r\n      to that I\u2019ll swear! Very glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry\r\n      on his way back to London again!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut what is it that alarms you?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cLook at Sir Charles\u2019s death! That was bad enough, for all that\r\n      the coroner said. Look at the noises on the moor at night.\r\n      There\u2019s not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for\r\n      it. Look at this stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and\r\n      waiting! What\u2019s he waiting for? What does it mean? It means no\r\n      good to anyone of the name of Baskerville, and very glad I shall\r\n      be to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry\u2019s new servants\r\n      are ready to take over the Hall.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut about this stranger,\u201d said I. \u201cCan you tell me anything\r\n      about him? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or\r\n      what he was doing?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives nothing\r\n      away. At first he thought that he was the police, but soon he\r\n      found that he had some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he\r\n      was, as far as he could see, but what he was doing he could not\r\n      make out.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd where did he say that he lived?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAmong the old houses on the hillside\u2014the stone huts where the\r\n      old folk used to live.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut how about his food?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSelden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and\r\n      brings all he needs. I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what\r\n      he wants.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery good, Barrymore. We may talk further of this some other\r\n      time.\u201d When the butler had gone I walked over to the black\r\n      window, and I looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds\r\n      and at the tossing outline of the wind-swept trees. It is a wild\r\n      night indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor.\r\n      What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in\r\n      such a place at such a time! And what deep and earnest purpose\r\n      can he have which calls for such a trial! There, in that hut upon\r\n      the moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has\r\n      vexed me so sorely. I swear that another day shall not have\r\n      passed before I have done all that man can do to reach the heart\r\n      of the mystery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11.\r\nThe Man on the Tor\r\n\r\n\r\n      The extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter\r\n      has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of October, a time\r\n      when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their\r\n      terrible conclusion. The incidents of the next few days are\r\n      indelibly graven upon my recollection, and I can tell them\r\n      without reference to the notes made at the time. I start them\r\n      from the day which succeeded that upon which I had established\r\n      two facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura Lyons of\r\n      Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made an\r\n      appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his\r\n      death, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be\r\n      found among the stone huts upon the hillside. With these two\r\n      facts in my possession I felt that either my intelligence or my\r\n      courage must be deficient if I could not throw some further light\r\n      upon these dark places.\r\n\r\n      I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned about\r\n      Mrs. Lyons upon the evening before, for Dr. Mortimer remained\r\n      with him at cards until it was very late. At breakfast, however,\r\n      I informed him about my discovery and asked him whether he would\r\n      care to accompany me to Coombe Tracey. At first he was very eager\r\n      to come, but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if I\r\n      went alone the results might be better. The more formal we made\r\n      the visit the less information we might obtain. I left Sir Henry\r\n      behind, therefore, not without some prickings of conscience, and\r\n      drove off upon my new quest.\r\n\r\n      When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins to put up the horses,\r\n      and I made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate.\r\n      I had no difficulty in finding her rooms, which were central and\r\n      well appointed. A maid showed me in without ceremony, and as I\r\n      entered the sitting-room a lady, who was sitting before a\r\n      Remington typewriter, sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome.\r\n      Her face fell, however, when she saw that I was a stranger, and\r\n      she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit.\r\n\r\n      The first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme\r\n      beauty. Her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, and\r\n      her cheeks, though considerably freckled, were flushed with the\r\n      exquisite bloom of the brunette, the dainty pink which lurks at\r\n      the heart of the sulphur rose. Admiration was, I repeat, the\r\n      first impression. But the second was criticism. There was\r\n      something subtly wrong with the face, some coarseness of\r\n      expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness of lip\r\n      which marred its perfect beauty. But these, of course, are\r\n      afterthoughts. At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in\r\n      the presence of a very handsome woman, and that she was asking me\r\n      the reasons for my visit. I had not quite understood until that\r\n      instant how delicate my mission was.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have the pleasure,\u201d said I, \u201cof knowing your father.\u201d\r\n\r\n      It was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it.\r\n      \u201cThere is nothing in common between my father and me,\u201d she said.\r\n      \u201cI owe him nothing, and his friends are not mine. If it were not\r\n      for the late Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I\r\n      might have starved for all that my father cared.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come\r\n      here to see you.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The freckles started out on the lady\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat can I tell you about him?\u201d she asked, and her fingers\r\n      played nervously over the stops of her typewriter.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou knew him, did you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness. If\r\n      I am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest\r\n      which he took in my unhappy situation.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid you correspond with him?\u201d\r\n\r\n      The lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is the object of these questions?\u201d she asked sharply.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe object is to avoid a public scandal. It is better that I\r\n      should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our\r\n      control.\u201d\r\n\r\n      She was silent and her face was still very pale. At last she\r\n      looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I\u2019ll answer,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are your questions?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid you correspond with Sir Charles?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his\r\n      delicacy and his generosity.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you the dates of those letters?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you ever met him?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. He was a\r\n      very retiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he\r\n      know enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say\r\n      that he has done?\u201d\r\n\r\n      She met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united\r\n      to help me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate\r\n      friend of Sir Charles\u2019s. He was exceedingly kind, and it was\r\n      through him that Sir Charles learned about my affairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton\r\n      his almoner upon several occasions, so the lady\u2019s statement bore\r\n      the impress of truth upon it.\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you?\u201d I\r\n      continued.\r\n\r\n      Mrs. Lyons flushed with anger again. \u201cReally, sir, this is a very\r\n      extraordinary question.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen I answer, certainly not.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot on the very day of Sir Charles\u2019s death?\u201d\r\n\r\n      The flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before\r\n      me. Her dry lips could not speak the \u201cNo\u201d which I saw rather than\r\n      heard.\r\n\r\n      \u201cSurely your memory deceives you,\u201d said I. \u201cI could even quote a\r\n      passage of your letter. It ran \u2018Please, please, as you are a\r\n      gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o\u2019clock.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n      I thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself by a\r\n      supreme effort.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs there no such thing as a gentleman?\u201d she gasped.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou do Sir Charles an injustice. He _did_ burn the letter. But\r\n      sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned. You\r\n      acknowledge now that you wrote it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, I did write it,\u201d she cried, pouring out her soul in a\r\n      torrent of words. \u201cI did write it. Why should I deny it? I have\r\n      no reason to be ashamed of it. I wished him to help me. I\r\n      believed that if I had an interview I could gain his help, so I\r\n      asked him to meet me.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut why at such an hour?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause I had only just learned that he was going to London next\r\n      day and might be away for months. There were reasons why I could\r\n      not get there earlier.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the\r\n      house?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor\u2019s\r\n      house?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, what happened when you did get there?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI never went.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMrs. Lyons!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred. I never went.\r\n      Something intervened to prevent my going.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat was that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is a private matter. I cannot tell it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir\r\n      Charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death, but\r\n      you deny that you kept the appointment.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Again and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get\r\n      past that point.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMrs. Lyons,\u201d said I as I rose from this long and inconclusive\r\n      interview, \u201cyou are taking a very great responsibility and\r\n      putting yourself in a very false position by not making an\r\n      absolutely clean breast of all that you know. If I have to call\r\n      in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are\r\n      compromised. If your position is innocent, why did you in the\r\n      first instance deny having written to Sir Charles upon that\r\n      date?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from\r\n      it and that I might find myself involved in a scandal.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy\r\n      your letter?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you have read the letter you will know.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI did not say that I had read all the letter.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou quoted some of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned\r\n      and it was not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that\r\n      you were so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter\r\n      which he received on the day of his death.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe matter is a very private one.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe more reason why you should avoid a public investigation.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will tell you, then. If you have heard anything of my unhappy\r\n      history you will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason\r\n      to regret it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have heard so much.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom I\r\n      abhor. The law is upon his side, and every day I am faced by the\r\n      possibility that he may force me to live with him. At the time\r\n      that I wrote this letter to Sir Charles I had learned that there\r\n      was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses\r\n      could be met. It meant everything to me\u2014peace of mind, happiness,\r\n      self-respect\u2014everything. I knew Sir Charles\u2019s generosity, and I\r\n      thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help\r\n      me.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen how is it that you did not go?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause I received help in the interval from another source.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy then, did you not write to Sir Charles and explain this?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper next\r\n      morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The woman\u2019s story hung coherently together, and all my questions\r\n      were unable to shake it. I could only check it by finding if she\r\n      had, indeed, instituted divorce proceedings against her husband\r\n      at or about the time of the tragedy.\r\n\r\n      It was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been\r\n      to Baskerville Hall if she really had been, for a trap would be\r\n      necessary to take her there, and could not have returned to\r\n      Coombe Tracey until the early hours of the morning. Such an\r\n      excursion could not be kept secret. The probability was,\r\n      therefore, that she was telling the truth, or, at least, a part\r\n      of the truth. I came away baffled and disheartened. Once again I\r\n      had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every\r\n      path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission. And yet\r\n      the more I thought of the lady\u2019s face and of her manner the more\r\n      I felt that something was being held back from me. Why should she\r\n      turn so pale? Why should she fight against every admission until\r\n      it was forced from her? Why should she have been so reticent at\r\n      the time of the tragedy? Surely the explanation of all this could\r\n      not be as innocent as she would have me believe. For the moment I\r\n      could proceed no farther in that direction, but must turn back to\r\n      that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts\r\n      upon the moor.\r\n\r\n      And that was a most vague direction. I realised it as I drove\r\n      back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient\r\n      people. Barrymore\u2019s only indication had been that the stranger\r\n      lived in one of these abandoned huts, and many hundreds of them\r\n      are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor. But\r\n      I had my own experience for a guide since it had shown me the man\r\n      himself standing upon the summit of the Black Tor. That, then,\r\n      should be the centre of my search. From there I should explore\r\n      every hut upon the moor until I lighted upon the right one. If\r\n      this man were inside it I should find out from his own lips, at\r\n      the point of my revolver if necessary, who he was and why he had\r\n      dogged us so long. He might slip away from us in the crowd of\r\n      Regent Street, but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely\r\n      moor. On the other hand, if I should find the hut and its tenant\r\n      should not be within it I must remain there, however long the\r\n      vigil, until he returned. Holmes had missed him in London. It\r\n      would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run him to earth\r\n      where my master had failed.\r\n\r\n      Luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now\r\n      at last it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune was\r\n      none other than Mr. Frankland, who was standing, grey-whiskered\r\n      and red-faced, outside the gate of his garden, which opened on to\r\n      the highroad along which I travelled.\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood-day, Dr. Watson,\u201d cried he with unwonted good humour, \u201cyou\r\n      must really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass\r\n      of wine and to congratulate me.\u201d\r\n\r\n      My feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after\r\n      what I had heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I was\r\n      anxious to send Perkins and the wagonette home, and the\r\n      opportunity was a good one. I alighted and sent a message to Sir\r\n      Henry that I should walk over in time for dinner. Then I followed\r\n      Frankland into his dining-room.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is a great day for me, sir\u2014one of the red-letter days of my\r\n      life,\u201d he cried with many chuckles. \u201cI have brought off a double\r\n      event. I mean to teach them in these parts that law is law, and\r\n      that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it. I have\r\n      established a right of way through the centre of old Middleton\u2019s\r\n      park, slap across it, sir, within a hundred yards of his own\r\n      front door. What do you think of that? We\u2019ll teach these magnates\r\n      that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners,\r\n      confound them! And I\u2019ve closed the wood where the Fernworthy folk\r\n      used to picnic. These infernal people seem to think that there\r\n      are no rights of property, and that they can swarm where they\r\n      like with their papers and their bottles. Both cases decided, Dr.\r\n      Watson, and both in my favour. I haven\u2019t had such a day since I\r\n      had Sir John Morland for trespass because he shot in his own\r\n      warren.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow on earth did you do that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cLook it up in the books, sir. It will repay reading\u2014Frankland\r\n      _v_. Morland, Court of Queen\u2019s Bench. It cost me \u00a3200, but I got\r\n      my verdict.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid it do you any good?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNone, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had no interest in the\r\n      matter. I act entirely from a sense of public duty. I have no\r\n      doubt, for example, that the Fernworthy people will burn me in\r\n      effigy tonight. I told the police last time they did it that they\r\n      should stop these disgraceful exhibitions. The County\r\n      Constabulary is in a scandalous state, sir, and it has not\r\n      afforded me the protection to which I am entitled. The case of\r\n      Frankland _v_. Regina will bring the matter before the attention\r\n      of the public. I told them that they would have occasion to\r\n      regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come\r\n      true.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow so?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n      The old man put on a very knowing expression. \u201cBecause I could\r\n      tell them what they are dying to know; but nothing would induce\r\n      me to help the rascals in any way.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get\r\n      away from his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it.\r\n      I had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to\r\n      understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest\r\n      way to stop his confidences.\r\n\r\n      \u201cSome poaching case, no doubt?\u201d said I with an indifferent\r\n      manner.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHa, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that!\r\n      What about the convict on the moor?\u201d\r\n\r\n      I stared. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that you know where he is?\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that I\r\n      could help the police to lay their hands on him. Has it never\r\n      struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where\r\n      he got his food and so trace it to him?\u201d\r\n\r\n      He certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth.\r\n      \u201cNo doubt,\u201d said I; \u201cbut how do you know that he is anywhere upon\r\n      the moor?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger who\r\n      takes him his food.\u201d\r\n\r\n      My heart sank for Barrymore. It was a serious thing to be in the\r\n      power of this spiteful old busybody. But his next remark took a\r\n      weight from my mind.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a\r\n      child. I see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. He\r\n      passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom should\r\n      he be going except to the convict?\u201d\r\n\r\n      Here was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance of\r\n      interest. A child! Barrymore had said that our unknown was\r\n      supplied by a boy. It was on his track, and not upon the\r\n      convict\u2019s, that Frankland had stumbled. If I could get his\r\n      knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But incredulity\r\n      and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of\r\n      one of the moorland shepherds taking out his father\u2019s dinner.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old\r\n      autocrat. His eyes looked malignantly at me, and his grey\r\n      whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIndeed, sir!\u201d said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching\r\n      moor. \u201cDo you see that Black Tor over yonder? Well, do you see\r\n      the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it? It is the\r\n      stoniest part of the whole moor. Is that a place where a shepherd\r\n      would be likely to take his station? Your suggestion, sir, is a\r\n      most absurd one.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the\r\n      facts. My submission pleased him and led him to further\r\n      confidences.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I\r\n      come to an opinion. I have seen the boy again and again with his\r\n      bundle. Every day, and sometimes twice a day, I have been\r\n      able\u2014but wait a moment, Dr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is\r\n      there at the present moment something moving upon that hillside?\u201d\r\n\r\n      It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark\r\n      dot against the dull green and grey.\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome, sir, come!\u201d cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. \u201cYou will\r\n      see with your own eyes and judge for yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod,\r\n      stood upon the flat leads of the house. Frankland clapped his eye\r\n      to it and gave a cry of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n      \u201cQuick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!\u201d\r\n\r\n      There he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle\r\n      upon his shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. When he reached\r\n      the crest I saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant\r\n      against the cold blue sky. He looked round him with a furtive and\r\n      stealthy air, as one who dreads pursuit. Then he vanished over\r\n      the hill.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell! Am I right?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cCertainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd what the errand is even a county constable could guess. But\r\n      not one word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecy\r\n      also, Dr. Watson. Not a word! You understand!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cJust as you wish.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey have treated me shamefully\u2014shamefully. When the facts come\r\n      out in Frankland _v_. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of\r\n      indignation will run through the country. Nothing would induce me\r\n      to help the police in any way. For all they cared it might have\r\n      been me, instead of my effigy, which these rascals burned at the\r\n      stake. Surely you are not going! You will help me to empty the\r\n      decanter in honour of this great occasion!\u201d\r\n\r\n      But I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading\r\n      him from his announced intention of walking home with me. I kept\r\n      the road as long as his eye was on me, and then I struck off\r\n      across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy\r\n      had disappeared. Everything was working in my favour, and I swore\r\n      that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that\r\n      I should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way.\r\n\r\n      The sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the\r\n      hill, and the long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on one\r\n      side and grey shadow on the other. A haze lay low upon the\r\n      farthest sky-line, out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of\r\n      Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the wide expanse there was no sound\r\n      and no movement. One great grey bird, a gull or curlew, soared\r\n      aloft in the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be the only living\r\n      things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath\r\n      it. The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mystery\r\n      and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart. The boy\r\n      was nowhere to be seen. But down beneath me in a cleft of the\r\n      hills there was a circle of the old stone huts, and in the middle\r\n      of them there was one which retained sufficient roof to act as a\r\n      screen against the weather. My heart leaped within me as I saw\r\n      it. This must be the burrow where the stranger lurked. At last my\r\n      foot was on the threshold of his hiding place\u2014his secret was\r\n      within my grasp.\r\n\r\n      As I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do\r\n      when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I\r\n      satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a\r\n      habitation. A vague pathway among the boulders led to the\r\n      dilapidated opening which served as a door. All was silent\r\n      within. The unknown might be lurking there, or he might be\r\n      prowling on the moor. My nerves tingled with the sense of\r\n      adventure. Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the\r\n      butt of my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, I looked\r\n      in. The place was empty.\r\n\r\n      But there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false\r\n      scent. This was certainly where the man lived. Some blankets\r\n      rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which\r\n      Neolithic man had once slumbered. The ashes of a fire were heaped\r\n      in a rude grate. Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket\r\n      half-full of water. A litter of empty tins showed that the place\r\n      had been occupied for some time, and I saw, as my eyes became\r\n      accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and a half-full\r\n      bottle of spirits standing in the corner. In the middle of the\r\n      hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this\r\n      stood a small cloth bundle\u2014the same, no doubt, which I had seen\r\n      through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy. It contained\r\n      a loaf of bread, a tinned tongue, and two tins of preserved\r\n      peaches. As I set it down again, after having examined it, my\r\n      heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper\r\n      with writing upon it. I raised it, and this was what I read,\r\n      roughly scrawled in pencil: \u201cDr. Watson has gone to Coombe\r\n      Tracey.\u201d\r\n\r\n      For a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking\r\n      out the meaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir\r\n      Henry, who was being dogged by this secret man. He had not\r\n      followed me himself, but he had set an agent\u2014the boy,\r\n      perhaps\u2014upon my track, and this was his report. Possibly I had\r\n      taken no step since I had been upon the moor which had not been\r\n      observed and reported. Always there was this feeling of an unseen\r\n      force, a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and\r\n      delicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme\r\n      moment that one realised that one was indeed entangled in its\r\n      meshes.\r\n\r\n      If there was one report there might be others, so I looked round\r\n      the hut in search of them. There was no trace, however, of\r\n      anything of the kind, nor could I discover any sign which might\r\n      indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this\r\n      singular place, save that he must be of Spartan habits and cared\r\n      little for the comforts of life. When I thought of the heavy\r\n      rains and looked at the gaping roof I understood how strong and\r\n      immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that\r\n      inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by\r\n      chance our guardian angel? I swore that I would not leave the hut\r\n      until I knew.\r\n\r\n      Outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with\r\n      scarlet and gold. Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches\r\n      by the distant pools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. There\r\n      were the two towers of Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur\r\n      of smoke which marked the village of Grimpen. Between the two,\r\n      behind the hill, was the house of the Stapletons. All was sweet\r\n      and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light, and yet as I\r\n      looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of Nature but\r\n      quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which\r\n      every instant was bringing nearer. With tingling nerves but a\r\n      fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited\r\n      with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant.\r\n\r\n      And then at last I heard him. Far away came the sharp clink of a\r\n      boot striking upon a stone. Then another and yet another, coming\r\n      nearer and nearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner and\r\n      cocked the pistol in my pocket, determined not to discover myself\r\n      until I had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger.\r\n      There was a long pause which showed that he had stopped. Then\r\n      once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the\r\n      opening of the hut.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is a lovely evening, my dear Watson,\u201d said a well-known\r\n      voice. \u201cI really think that you will be more comfortable outside\r\n      than in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12.\r\nDeath on the Moor\r\n\r\n\r\n      For a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my\r\n      ears. Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a\r\n      crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be\r\n      lifted from my soul. That cold, incisive, ironical voice could\r\n      belong to but one man in all the world.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHolmes!\u201d I cried\u2014\u201cHolmes!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome out,\u201d said he, \u201cand please be careful with the revolver.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone\r\n      outside, his grey eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon\r\n      my astonished features. He was thin and worn, but clear and\r\n      alert, his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the\r\n      wind. In his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other\r\n      tourist upon the moor, and he had contrived, with that catlike\r\n      love of personal cleanliness which was one of his\r\n      characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen\r\n      as perfect as if he were in Baker Street.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI never was more glad to see anyone in my life,\u201d said I as I\r\n      wrung him by the hand.\r\n\r\n      \u201cOr more astonished, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I must confess to it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. I had no\r\n      idea that you had found my occasional retreat, still less that\r\n      you were inside it, until I was within twenty paces of the door.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy footprint, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your\r\n      footprint amid all the footprints of the world. If you seriously\r\n      desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when I\r\n      see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know\r\n      that my friend Watson is in the neighbourhood. You will see it\r\n      there beside the path. You threw it down, no doubt, at that\r\n      supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI thought as much\u2014and knowing your admirable tenacity I was\r\n      convinced that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach,\r\n      waiting for the tenant to return. So you actually thought that I\r\n      was the criminal?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExcellent, Watson! And how did you localise me? You saw me,\r\n      perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so\r\n      imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, I saw you then.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this\r\n      one?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where\r\n      to look.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. I could not make\r\n      it out when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens.\u201d He\r\n      rose and peeped into the hut. \u201cHa, I see that Cartwright has\r\n      brought up some supplies. What\u2019s this paper? So you have been to\r\n      Coombe Tracey, have you?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo see Mrs. Laura Lyons?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell done! Our researches have evidently been running on\r\n      parallel lines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall\r\n      have a fairly full knowledge of the case.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the\r\n      responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my\r\n      nerves. But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what\r\n      have you been doing? I thought that you were in Baker Street\r\n      working out that case of blackmailing.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat was what I wished you to think.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you use me, and yet do not trust me!\u201d I cried with some\r\n      bitterness. \u201cI think that I have deserved better at your hands,\r\n      Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in\r\n      many other cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have\r\n      seemed to play a trick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your\r\n      own sake that I did it, and it was my appreciation of the danger\r\n      which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter\r\n      for myself. Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is confident\r\n      that my point of view would have been the same as yours, and my\r\n      presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on\r\n      their guard. As it is, I have been able to get about as I could\r\n      not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and I\r\n      remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all\r\n      my weight at a critical moment.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut why keep me in the dark?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cFor you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have\r\n      led to my discovery. You would have wished to tell me something,\r\n      or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or\r\n      other, and so an unnecessary risk would be run. I brought\r\n      Cartwright down with me\u2014you remember the little chap at the\r\n      express office\u2014and he has seen after my simple wants: a loaf of\r\n      bread and a clean collar. What does man want more? He has given\r\n      me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet, and\r\n      both have been invaluable.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen my reports have all been wasted!\u201d\u2014My voice trembled as I\r\n      recalled the pains and the pride with which I had composed them.\r\n\r\n      Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHere are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I\r\n      assure you. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only\r\n      delayed one day upon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly\r\n      upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an\r\n      extraordinarily difficult case.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I was still rather raw over the deception which had been\r\n      practised upon me, but the warmth of Holmes\u2019s praise drove my\r\n      anger from my mind. I felt also in my heart that he was right in\r\n      what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that I\r\n      should not have known that he was upon the moor.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face.\r\n      \u201cAnd now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons\u2014it\r\n      was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you\r\n      had gone, for I am already aware that she is the one person in\r\n      Coombe Tracey who might be of service to us in the matter. In\r\n      fact, if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that I\r\n      should have gone tomorrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had\r\n      turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There,\r\n      sitting together in the twilight, I told Holmes of my\r\n      conversation with the lady. So interested was he that I had to\r\n      repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis is most important,\u201d said he when I had concluded. \u201cIt fills\r\n      up a gap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex\r\n      affair. You are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists\r\n      between this lady and the man Stapleton?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI did not know of a close intimacy.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere can be no doubt about the matter. They meet, they write,\r\n      there is a complete understanding between them. Now, this puts a\r\n      very powerful weapon into our hands. If I could only use it to\r\n      detach his wife\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHis wife?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am giving you some information now, in return for all that you\r\n      have given me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is\r\n      in reality his wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what you say? How could he\r\n      have permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSir Henry\u2019s falling in love could do no harm to anyone except\r\n      Sir Henry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make\r\n      love to her, as you have yourself observed. I repeat that the\r\n      lady is his wife and not his sister.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut why this elaborate deception?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to\r\n      him in the character of a free woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n      All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took\r\n      shape and centred upon the naturalist. In that impassive\r\n      colourless man, with his straw hat and his butterfly-net, I\r\n      seemed to see something terrible\u2014a creature of infinite patience\r\n      and craft, with a smiling face and a murderous heart.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is he, then, who is our enemy\u2014it is he who dogged us in\r\n      London?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo I read the riddle.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the warning\u2014it must have come from her!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed,\r\n      loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut are you sure of this, Holmes? How do you know that the woman\r\n      is his wife?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of\r\n      autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare\r\n      say he has many a time regretted it since. He was once a\r\n      schoolmaster in the north of England. Now, there is no one more\r\n      easy to trace than a schoolmaster. There are scholastic agencies\r\n      by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession.\r\n      A little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief\r\n      under atrocious circumstances, and that the man who had owned\r\n      it\u2014the name was different\u2014had disappeared with his wife. The\r\n      descriptions agreed. When I learned that the missing man was\r\n      devoted to entomology the identification was complete.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the\r\n      shadows.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf this woman is in truth his wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyons\r\n      come in?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is one of the points upon which your own researches have\r\n      shed a light. Your interview with the lady has cleared the\r\n      situation very much. I did not know about a projected divorce\r\n      between herself and her husband. In that case, regarding\r\n      Stapleton as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt upon becoming\r\n      his wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd when she is undeceived?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, then we may find the lady of service. It must be our first\r\n      duty to see her\u2014both of us\u2014tomorrow. Don\u2019t you think, Watson,\r\n      that you are away from your charge rather long? Your place should\r\n      be at Baskerville Hall.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had\r\n      settled upon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in a\r\n      violet sky.\r\n\r\n      \u201cOne last question, Holmes,\u201d I said as I rose. \u201cSurely there is\r\n      no need of secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it\r\n      all? What is he after?\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes\u2019s voice sank as he answered:\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is murder, Watson\u2014refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder.\r\n      Do not ask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even\r\n      as his are upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already\r\n      almost at my mercy. There is but one danger which can threaten\r\n      us. It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so.\r\n      Another day\u2014two at the most\u2014and I have my case complete, but\r\n      until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother\r\n      watched her ailing child. Your mission today has justified\r\n      itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his\r\n      side. Hark!\u201d\r\n\r\n      A terrible scream\u2014a prolonged yell of horror and anguish\u2014burst\r\n      out of the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the\r\n      blood to ice in my veins.\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, my God!\u201d I gasped. \u201cWhat is it? What does it mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic\r\n      outline at the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head\r\n      thrust forward, his face peering into the darkness.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHush!\u201d he whispered. \u201cHush!\u201d\r\n\r\n      The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had\r\n      pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it\r\n      burst upon our ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere is it?\u201d Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of\r\n      his voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul.\r\n      \u201cWhere is it, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere, I think.\u201d I pointed into the darkness.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, there!\u201d\r\n\r\n      Again the agonised cry swept through the silent night, louder and\r\n      much nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep,\r\n      muttered rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling\r\n      like the low, constant murmur of the sea.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe hound!\u201d cried Holmes. \u201cCome, Watson, come! Great heavens, if\r\n      we are too late!\u201d\r\n\r\n      He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed\r\n      at his heels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground\r\n      immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell,\r\n      and then a dull, heavy thud. We halted and listened. Not another\r\n      sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night.\r\n\r\n      I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted.\r\n      He stamped his feet upon the ground.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no, surely not!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cFool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comes\r\n      of abandoning your charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst has\r\n      happened we\u2019ll avenge him!\u201d\r\n\r\n      Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders,\r\n      forcing our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and\r\n      rushing down slopes, heading always in the direction whence those\r\n      dreadful sounds had come. At every rise Holmes looked eagerly\r\n      round him, but the shadows were thick upon the moor, and nothing\r\n      moved upon its dreary face.\r\n\r\n      \u201cCan you see anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut, hark, what is that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      A low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon our\r\n      left! On that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which\r\n      overlooked a stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face was\r\n      spread-eagled some dark, irregular object. As we ran towards it\r\n      the vague outline hardened into a definite shape. It was a\r\n      prostrate man face downward upon the ground, the head doubled\r\n      under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded and the body\r\n      hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault. So\r\n      grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant\r\n      realise that that moan had been the passing of his soul. Not a\r\n      whisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark figure over which\r\n      we stooped. Holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again\r\n      with an exclamation of horror. The gleam of the match which he\r\n      struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool\r\n      which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim. And it\r\n      shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint\r\n      within us\u2014the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!\r\n\r\n      There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar\r\n      ruddy tweed suit\u2014the very one which he had worn on the first\r\n      morning that we had seen him in Baker Street. We caught the one\r\n      clear glimpse of it, and then the match flickered and went out,\r\n      even as the hope had gone out of our souls. Holmes groaned, and\r\n      his face glimmered white through the darkness.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe brute! The brute!\u201d I cried with clenched hands. \u201cOh Holmes,\r\n      I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my case\r\n      well rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my\r\n      client. It is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my\r\n      career. But how could I know\u2014how _could_ I know\u2014that he would\r\n      risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my\r\n      warnings?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat we should have heard his screams\u2014my God, those screams!\u2014and\r\n      yet have been unable to save him! Where is this brute of a hound\r\n      which drove him to his death? It may be lurking among these rocks\r\n      at this instant. And Stapleton, where is he? He shall answer for\r\n      this deed.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have been\r\n      murdered\u2014the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast\r\n      which he thought to be supernatural, the other driven to his end\r\n      in his wild flight to escape from it. But now we have to prove\r\n      the connection between the man and the beast. Save from what we\r\n      heard, we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter, since\r\n      Sir Henry has evidently died from the fall. But, by heavens,\r\n      cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power before another\r\n      day is past!\u201d\r\n\r\n      We stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body,\r\n      overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had\r\n      brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. Then\r\n      as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which\r\n      our poor friend had fallen, and from the summit we gazed out over\r\n      the shadowy moor, half silver and half gloom. Far away, miles\r\n      off, in the direction of Grimpen, a single steady yellow light\r\n      was shining. It could only come from the lonely abode of the\r\n      Stapletons. With a bitter curse I shook my fist at it as I gazed.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy should we not seize him at once?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOur case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to the\r\n      last degree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we\r\n      make one false move the villain may escape us yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere will be plenty for us to do tomorrow. Tonight we can only\r\n      perform the last offices to our poor friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and\r\n      approached the body, black and clear against the silvered stones.\r\n      The agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain\r\n      and blurred my eyes with tears.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe must send for help, Holmes! We cannot carry him all the way\r\n      to the Hall. Good heavens, are you mad?\u201d\r\n\r\n      He had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancing\r\n      and laughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern,\r\n      self-contained friend? These were hidden fires, indeed!\r\n\r\n      \u201cA beard! A beard! The man has a beard!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cA beard?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is not the baronet\u2014it is\u2014why, it is my neighbour, the\r\n      convict!\u201d\r\n\r\n      With feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that\r\n      dripping beard was pointing up to the cold, clear moon. There\r\n      could be no doubt about the beetling forehead, the sunken animal\r\n      eyes. It was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the\r\n      light of the candle from over the rock\u2014the face of Selden, the\r\n      criminal.\r\n\r\n      Then in an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how the\r\n      baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to\r\n      Barrymore. Barrymore had passed it on in order to help Selden in\r\n      his escape. Boots, shirt, cap\u2014it was all Sir Henry\u2019s. The tragedy\r\n      was still black enough, but this man had at least deserved death\r\n      by the laws of his country. I told Holmes how the matter stood,\r\n      my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen the clothes have been the poor devil\u2019s death,\u201d said he. \u201cIt\r\n      is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article\r\n      of Sir Henry\u2019s\u2014the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all\r\n      probability\u2014and so ran this man down. There is one very singular\r\n      thing, however: How came Selden, in the darkness, to know that\r\n      the hound was on his trail?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe heard him.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like\r\n      this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk\r\n      recapture by screaming wildly for help. By his cries he must have\r\n      run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track. How did\r\n      he know?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cA greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all\r\n      our conjectures are correct\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI presume nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I suppose\r\n      that it does not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton would\r\n      not let it go unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would\r\n      be there.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think\r\n      that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while\r\n      mine may remain forever a mystery. The question now is, what\r\n      shall we do with this poor wretch\u2019s body? We cannot leave it here\r\n      to the foxes and the ravens.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can\r\n      communicate with the police.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far.\r\n      Halloa, Watson, what\u2019s this? It\u2019s the man himself, by all that\u2019s\r\n      wonderful and audacious! Not a word to show your suspicions\u2014not a\r\n      word, or my plans crumble to the ground.\u201d\r\n\r\n      A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red\r\n      glow of a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish\r\n      the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stopped\r\n      when he saw us, and then came on again.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, Dr. Watson, that\u2019s not you, is it? You are the last man\r\n      that I should have expected to see out on the moor at this time\r\n      of night. But, dear me, what\u2019s this? Somebody hurt? Not\u2014don\u2019t\r\n      tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry!\u201d He hurried past me and\r\n      stooped over the dead man. I heard a sharp intake of his breath\r\n      and the cigar fell from his fingers.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho\u2014who\u2019s this?\u201d he stammered.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort\r\n      he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked\r\n      sharply from Holmes to me. \u201cDear me! What a very shocking affair!\r\n      How did he die?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks.\r\n      My friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy\r\n      about Sir Henry.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy about Sir Henry in particular?\u201d I could not help asking.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause I had suggested that he should come over. When he did\r\n      not come I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his\r\n      safety when I heard cries upon the moor. By the way\u201d\u2014his eyes\r\n      darted again from my face to Holmes\u2019s\u2014\u201cdid you hear anything else\r\n      besides a cry?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cdid you?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you mean, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom\r\n      hound, and so on. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor.\r\n      I was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound\r\n      tonight.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe heard nothing of the kind,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd what is your theory of this poor fellow\u2019s death?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off\r\n      his head. He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and\r\n      eventually fallen over here and broken his neck.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat seems the most reasonable theory,\u201d said Stapleton, and he\r\n      gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief. \u201cWhat do you\r\n      think about it, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n      My friend bowed his compliments. \u201cYou are quick at\r\n      identification,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came\r\n      down. You are in time to see a tragedy.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend\u2019s explanation will\r\n      cover the facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to\r\n      London with me tomorrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, you return tomorrow?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is my intention.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences\r\n      which have puzzled us?\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n      \u201cOne cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An\r\n      investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours. It has not\r\n      been a satisfactory case.\u201d\r\n\r\n      My friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner.\r\n      Stapleton still looked hard at him. Then he turned to me.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it\r\n      would give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified\r\n      in doing it. I think that if we put something over his face he\r\n      will be safe until morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n      And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton\u2019s offer of\r\n      hospitality, Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving\r\n      the naturalist to return alone. Looking back we saw the figure\r\n      moving slowly away over the broad moor, and behind him that one\r\n      black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was\r\n      lying who had come so horribly to his end.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe\u2019re at close grips at last,\u201d said Holmes as we walked together\r\n      across the moor. \u201cWhat a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled\r\n      himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing\r\n      shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his\r\n      plot. I told you in London, Watson, and I tell you now again,\r\n      that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am sorry that he has seen you.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he\r\n      knows you are here?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to\r\n      desperate measures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may be\r\n      too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has\r\n      completely deceived us.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy should we not arrest him at once?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Your\r\n      instinct is always to do something energetic. But supposing, for\r\n      argument\u2019s sake, that we had him arrested tonight, what on earth\r\n      the better off should we be for that? We could prove nothing\r\n      against him. There\u2019s the devilish cunning of it! If he were\r\n      acting through a human agent we could get some evidence, but if\r\n      we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not\r\n      help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSurely we have a case.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot a shadow of one\u2014only surmise and conjecture. We should be\r\n      laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such\r\n      evidence.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is Sir Charles\u2019s death.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cFound dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died\r\n      of sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him, but how\r\n      are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs are\r\n      there of a hound? Where are the marks of its fangs? Of course we\r\n      know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles\r\n      was dead before ever the brute overtook him. But we have to prove\r\n      all this, and we are not in a position to do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, then, tonight?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no direct\r\n      connection between the hound and the man\u2019s death. We never saw\r\n      the hound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it was\r\n      running upon this man\u2019s trail. There is a complete absence of\r\n      motive. No, my dear fellow; we must reconcile ourselves to the\r\n      fact that we have no case at present, and that it is worth our\r\n      while to run any risk in order to establish one.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd how do you propose to do so?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when\r\n      the position of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my own\r\n      plan as well. Sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof; but I\r\n      hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in\r\n      thought, as far as the Baskerville gates.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you coming up?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last word,\r\n      Watson. Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. Let him think that\r\n      Selden\u2019s death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He will\r\n      have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo\r\n      tomorrow, when he is engaged, if I remember your report aright,\r\n      to dine with these people.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd so am I.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will be\r\n      easily arranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, I think\r\n      that we are both ready for our suppers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13.\r\nFixing the Nets\r\n\r\n\r\n      Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes,\r\n      for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would\r\n      bring him down from London. He did raise his eyebrows, however,\r\n      when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any\r\n      explanations for its absence. Between us we soon supplied his\r\n      wants, and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronet\r\n      as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should\r\n      know. But first I had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to\r\n      Barrymore and his wife. To him it may have been an unmitigated\r\n      relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron. To all the world he\r\n      was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her\r\n      he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood, the\r\n      child who had clung to her hand. Evil indeed is the man who has\r\n      not one woman to mourn him.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ve been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in\r\n      the morning,\u201d said the baronet. \u201cI guess I should have some\r\n      credit, for I have kept my promise. If I hadn\u2019t sworn not to go\r\n      about alone I might have had a more lively evening, for I had a\r\n      message from Stapleton asking me over there.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,\u201d\r\n      said Holmes drily. \u201cBy the way, I don\u2019t suppose you appreciate\r\n      that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck?\u201d\r\n\r\n      Sir Henry opened his eyes. \u201cHow was that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear your\r\n      servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the\r\n      police.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is unlikely. There was no mark on any of them, as far as I\r\n      know.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s lucky for him\u2014in fact, it\u2019s lucky for all of you, since\r\n      you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter. I am not\r\n      sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to\r\n      arrest the whole household. Watson\u2019s reports are most\r\n      incriminating documents.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut how about the case?\u201d asked the baronet. \u201cHave you made\r\n      anything out of the tangle? I don\u2019t know that Watson and I are\r\n      much the wiser since we came down.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think that I shall be in a position to make the situation\r\n      rather more clear to you before long. It has been an exceedingly\r\n      difficult and most complicated business. There are several points\r\n      upon which we still want light\u2014but it is coming all the same.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe\u2019ve had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. We\r\n      heard the hound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not all\r\n      empty superstition. I had something to do with dogs when I was\r\n      out West, and I know one when I hear one. If you can muzzle that\r\n      one and put him on a chain I\u2019ll be ready to swear you are the\r\n      greatest detective of all time.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will\r\n      give me your help.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhatever you tell me to do I will do.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without\r\n      always asking the reason.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cJust as you like.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you will do this I think the chances are that our little\r\n      problem will soon be solved. I have no doubt\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the\r\n      air. The lamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so\r\n      still that it might have been that of a clear-cut classical\r\n      statue, a personification of alertness and expectation.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is it?\u201d we both cried.\r\n\r\n      I could see as he looked down that he was repressing some\r\n      internal emotion. His features were still composed, but his eyes\r\n      shone with amused exultation.\r\n\r\n      \u201cExcuse the admiration of a connoisseur,\u201d said he as he waved his\r\n      hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite\r\n      wall. \u201cWatson won\u2019t allow that I know anything of art but that is\r\n      mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ. Now,\r\n      these are a really very fine series of portraits.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad to hear you say so,\u201d said Sir Henry, glancing\r\n      with some surprise at my friend. \u201cI don\u2019t pretend to know much\r\n      about these things, and I\u2019d be a better judge of a horse or a\r\n      steer than of a picture. I didn\u2019t know that you found time for\r\n      such things.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That\u2019s a\r\n      Kneller, I\u2019ll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and\r\n      the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are\r\n      all family portraits, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvery one.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you know the names?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBarrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say my\r\n      lessons fairly well.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho is the gentleman with the telescope?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the\r\n      West Indies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is\r\n      Sir William Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the\r\n      House of Commons under Pitt.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd this Cavalier opposite to me\u2014the one with the black velvet\r\n      and the lace?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, you have a right to know about him. That is the cause of all\r\n      the mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the\r\n      Baskervilles. We\u2019re not likely to forget him.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.\r\n\r\n      \u201cDear me!\u201d said Holmes, \u201che seems a quiet, meek-mannered man\r\n      enough, but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his\r\n      eyes. I had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the\r\n      date, 1647, are on the back of the canvas.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer\r\n      seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were\r\n      continually fixed upon it during supper. It was not until later,\r\n      when Sir Henry had gone to his room, that I was able to follow\r\n      the trend of his thoughts. He led me back into the\r\n      banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he held it\r\n      up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you see anything there?\u201d\r\n\r\n      I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the\r\n      white lace collar, and the straight, severe face which was framed\r\n      between them. It was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim,\r\n      hard, and stern, with a firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly\r\n      intolerant eye.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs it like anyone you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is something of Sir Henry about the jaw.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cJust a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!\u201d He stood upon\r\n      a chair, and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curved\r\n      his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried in amazement.\r\n\r\n      The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHa, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine faces\r\n      and not their trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminal\r\n      investigator that he should see through a disguise.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut this is marvellous. It might be his portrait.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appears\r\n      to be both physical and spiritual. A study of family portraits is\r\n      enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation. The\r\n      fellow is a Baskerville\u2014that is evident.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWith designs upon the succession.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly. This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of\r\n      our most obvious missing links. We have him, Watson, we have him,\r\n      and I dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering\r\n      in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies. A pin, a\r\n      cork, and a card, and we add him to the Baker Street collection!\u201d\r\n      He burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away\r\n      from the picture. I have not heard him laugh often, and it has\r\n      always boded ill to somebody.\r\n\r\n      I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier\r\n      still, for I saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, we should have a full day today,\u201d he remarked, and he\r\n      rubbed his hands with the joy of action. \u201cThe nets are all in\r\n      place, and the drag is about to begin. We\u2019ll know before the day\r\n      is out whether we have caught our big, lean-jawed pike, or\r\n      whether he has got through the meshes.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you been on the moor already?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death\r\n      of Selden. I think I can promise that none of you will be\r\n      troubled in the matter. And I have also communicated with my\r\n      faithful Cartwright, who would certainly have pined away at the\r\n      door of my hut, as a dog does at his master\u2019s grave, if I had not\r\n      set his mind at rest about my safety.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is the next move?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood-morning, Holmes,\u201d said the baronet. \u201cYou look like a\r\n      general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd so do I.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery good. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our\r\n      friends the Stapletons tonight.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable people,\r\n      and I am sure that they would be very glad to see you.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI fear that Watson and I must go to London.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo London?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, I think that we should be more useful there at the present\r\n      juncture.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The baronet\u2019s face perceptibly lengthened.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI hoped that you were going to see me through this business. The\r\n      Hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is\r\n      alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what\r\n      I tell you. You can tell your friends that we should have been\r\n      happy to have come with you, but that urgent business required us\r\n      to be in town. We hope very soon to return to Devonshire. Will\r\n      you remember to give them that message?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you insist upon it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is no alternative, I assure you.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I saw by the baronet\u2019s clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by\r\n      what he regarded as our desertion.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen do you desire to go?\u201d he asked coldly.\r\n\r\n      \u201cImmediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe Tracey,\r\n      but Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come\r\n      back to you. Watson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell\r\n      him that you regret that you cannot come.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have a good mind to go to London with you,\u201d said the baronet.\r\n      \u201cWhy should I stay here alone?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your word\r\n      that you would do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAll right, then, I\u2019ll stay.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOne more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Send\r\n      back your trap, however, and let them know that you intend to\r\n      walk home.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo walk across the moor?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me\r\n      not to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis time you may do it with safety. If I had not every\r\n      confidence in your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but\r\n      it is essential that you should do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen I will do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd as you value your life do not go across the moor in any\r\n      direction save along the straight path which leads from Merripit\r\n      House to the Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will do just what you say.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast\r\n      as possible, so as to reach London in the afternoon.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that\r\n      Holmes had said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit\r\n      would terminate next day. It had not crossed my mind however,\r\n      that he would wish me to go with him, nor could I understand how\r\n      we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to\r\n      be critical. There was nothing for it, however, but implicit\r\n      obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful friend, and a couple\r\n      of hours afterwards we were at the station of Coombe Tracey and\r\n      had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A small boy was\r\n      waiting upon the platform.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAny orders, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment you\r\n      arrive you will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name,\r\n      to say that if he finds the pocketbook which I have dropped he is\r\n      to send it by registered post to Baker Street.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd ask at the station office if there is a message for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. It\r\n      ran:\r\n\r\n      Wire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrive\r\n      five-forty. Lestrade.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of the\r\n      professionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now,\r\n      Watson, I think that we cannot employ our time better than by\r\n      calling upon your acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.\u201d\r\n\r\n      His plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He would use\r\n      the baronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were\r\n      really gone, while we should actually return at the instant when\r\n      we were likely to be needed. That telegram from London, if\r\n      mentioned by Sir Henry to the Stapletons, must remove the last\r\n      suspicions from their minds. Already I seemed to see our nets\r\n      drawing closer around that lean-jawed pike.\r\n\r\n      Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened\r\n      his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably\r\n      amazed her.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of\r\n      the late Sir Charles Baskerville,\u201d said he. \u201cMy friend here, Dr.\r\n      Watson, has informed me of what you have communicated, and also\r\n      of what you have withheld in connection with that matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat have I withheld?\u201d she asked defiantly.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate\r\n      at ten o\u2019clock. We know that that was the place and hour of his\r\n      death. You have withheld what the connection is between these\r\n      events.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is no connection.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary\r\n      one. But I think that we shall succeed in establishing a\r\n      connection, after all. I wish to be perfectly frank with you,\r\n      Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as one of murder, and the\r\n      evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr. Stapleton but his\r\n      wife as well.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The lady sprang from her chair.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHis wife!\u201d she cried.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed for\r\n      his sister is really his wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Mrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the arms\r\n      of her chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with\r\n      the pressure of her grip.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHis wife!\u201d she said again. \u201cHis wife! He is not a married man.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n      \u201cProve it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so\u2014!\u201d\r\n\r\n      The fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have come prepared to do so,\u201d said Holmes, drawing several\r\n      papers from his pocket. \u201cHere is a photograph of the couple taken\r\n      in York four years ago. It is indorsed \u2018Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,\u2019\r\n      but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him, and her also,\r\n      if you know her by sight. Here are three written descriptions by\r\n      trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time\r\n      kept St. Oliver\u2019s private school. Read them and see if you can\r\n      doubt the identity of these people.\u201d\r\n\r\n      She glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set, rigid\r\n      face of a desperate woman.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMr. Holmes,\u201d she said, \u201cthis man had offered me marriage on\r\n      condition that I could get a divorce from my husband. He has lied\r\n      to me, the villain, in every conceivable way. Not one word of\r\n      truth has he ever told me. And why\u2014why? I imagined that all was\r\n      for my own sake. But now I see that I was never anything but a\r\n      tool in his hands. Why should I preserve faith with him who never\r\n      kept any with me? Why should I try to shield him from the\r\n      consequences of his own wicked acts? Ask me what you like, and\r\n      there is nothing which I shall hold back. One thing I swear to\r\n      you, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of\r\n      any harm to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI entirely believe you, madam,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cThe\r\n      recital of these events must be very painful to you, and perhaps\r\n      it will make it easier if I tell you what occurred, and you can\r\n      check me if I make any material mistake. The sending of this\r\n      letter was suggested to you by Stapleton?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe dictated it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive\r\n      help from Sir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your\r\n      divorce?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from\r\n      keeping the appointment?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other\r\n      man should find the money for such an object, and that though he\r\n      was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing\r\n      the obstacles which divided us.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe appears to be a very consistent character. And then you heard\r\n      nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with\r\n      Sir Charles?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe did. He said that the death was a very mysterious one, and\r\n      that I should certainly be suspected if the facts came out. He\r\n      frightened me into remaining silent.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cQuite so. But you had your suspicions?\u201d\r\n\r\n      She hesitated and looked down.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI knew him,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if he had kept faith with me I\r\n      should always have done so with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape,\u201d said\r\n      Sherlock Holmes. \u201cYou have had him in your power and he knew it,\r\n      and yet you are alive. You have been walking for some months very\r\n      near to the edge of a precipice. We must wish you good-morning\r\n      now, Mrs. Lyons, and it is probable that you will very shortly\r\n      hear from us again.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOur case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty\r\n      thins away in front of us,\u201d said Holmes as we stood waiting for\r\n      the arrival of the express from town. \u201cI shall soon be in the\r\n      position of being able to put into a single connected narrative\r\n      one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times.\r\n      Students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in\r\n      Godno, in Little Russia, in the year \u201966, and of course there are\r\n      the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but this case possesses\r\n      some features which are entirely its own. Even now we have no\r\n      clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very much\r\n      surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this\r\n      night.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The London express came roaring into the station, and a small,\r\n      wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. We\r\n      all three shook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way\r\n      in which Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a\r\n      good deal since the days when they had first worked together. I\r\n      could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner\r\n      used then to excite in the practical man.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnything good?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe biggest thing for years,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWe have two hours\r\n      before we need think of starting. I think we might employ it in\r\n      getting some dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London\r\n      fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night\r\n      air of Dartmoor. Never been there? Ah, well, I don\u2019t suppose you\r\n      will forget your first visit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14.\r\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\r\n\r\n\r\n      One of Sherlock Holmes\u2019s defects\u2014if, indeed, one may call it a\r\n      defect\u2014was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full\r\n      plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment.\r\n      Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which\r\n      loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him. Partly\r\n      also from his professional caution, which urged him never to take\r\n      any chances. The result, however, was very trying for those who\r\n      were acting as his agents and assistants. I had often suffered\r\n      under it, but never more so than during that long drive in the\r\n      darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we were\r\n      about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing,\r\n      and I could only surmise what his course of action would be. My\r\n      nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon\r\n      our faces and the dark, void spaces on either side of the narrow\r\n      road told me that we were back upon the moor once again. Every\r\n      stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us\r\n      nearer to our supreme adventure.\r\n\r\n      Our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of\r\n      the hired wagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial\r\n      matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation.\r\n      It was a relief to me, after that unnatural restraint, when we at\r\n      last passed Frankland\u2019s house and knew that we were drawing near\r\n      to the Hall and to the scene of action. We did not drive up to\r\n      the door but got down near the gate of the avenue. The wagonette\r\n      was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe Tracey forthwith,\r\n      while we started to walk to Merripit House.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you armed, Lestrade?\u201d\r\n\r\n      The little detective smiled. \u201cAs long as I have my trousers I\r\n      have a hip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have\r\n      something in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019re mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes. What\u2019s the\r\n      game now?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cA waiting game.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy word, it does not seem a very cheerful place,\u201d said the\r\n      detective with a shiver, glancing round him at the gloomy slopes\r\n      of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the\r\n      Grimpen Mire. \u201cI see the lights of a house ahead of us.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I must\r\n      request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper.\u201d\r\n\r\n      We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the\r\n      house, but Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards\r\n      from it.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis will do,\u201d said he. \u201cThese rocks upon the right make an\r\n      admirable screen.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe are to wait here?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,\r\n      Lestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson?\r\n      Can you tell the position of the rooms? What are those latticed\r\n      windows at this end?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think they are the kitchen windows.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the one beyond, which shines so brightly?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is certainly the dining-room.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe blinds are up. You know the lie of the land best. Creep\r\n      forward quietly and see what they are doing\u2014but for heaven\u2019s sake\r\n      don\u2019t let them know that they are watched!\u201d\r\n\r\n      I tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which\r\n      surrounded the stunted orchard. Creeping in its shadow I reached\r\n      a point whence I could look straight through the uncurtained\r\n      window.\r\n\r\n      There were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton.\r\n      They sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the\r\n      round table. Both of them were smoking cigars, and coffee and\r\n      wine were in front of them. Stapleton was talking with animation,\r\n      but the baronet looked pale and distrait. Perhaps the thought of\r\n      that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily\r\n      upon his mind.\r\n\r\n      As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir\r\n      Henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair,\r\n      puffing at his cigar. I heard the creak of a door and the crisp\r\n      sound of boots upon gravel. The steps passed along the path on\r\n      the other side of the wall under which I crouched. Looking over,\r\n      I saw the naturalist pause at the door of an out-house in the\r\n      corner of the orchard. A key turned in a lock, and as he passed\r\n      in there was a curious scuffling noise from within. He was only a\r\n      minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn once more and\r\n      he passed me and reentered the house. I saw him rejoin his guest,\r\n      and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to\r\n      tell them what I had seen.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou say, Watson, that the lady is not there?\u201d Holmes asked when\r\n      I had finished my report.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere can she be, then, since there is no light in any other\r\n      room except the kitchen?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI cannot think where she is.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense,\r\n      white fog. It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked\r\n      itself up like a wall on that side of us, low but thick and well\r\n      defined. The moon shone on it, and it looked like a great\r\n      shimmering ice-field, with the heads of the distant tors as rocks\r\n      borne upon its surface. Holmes\u2019s face was turned towards it, and\r\n      he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s moving towards us, Watson.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs that serious?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery serious, indeed\u2014the one thing upon earth which could have\r\n      disarranged my plans. He can\u2019t be very long, now. It is already\r\n      ten o\u2019clock. Our success and even his life may depend upon his\r\n      coming out before the fog is over the path.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold and\r\n      bright, while a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft,\r\n      uncertain light. Before us lay the dark bulk of the house, its\r\n      serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the\r\n      silver-spangled sky. Broad bars of golden light from the lower\r\n      windows stretched across the orchard and the moor. One of them\r\n      was suddenly shut off. The servants had left the kitchen. There\r\n      only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the two men, the\r\n      murderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted over\r\n      their cigars.\r\n\r\n      Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half of\r\n      the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house. Already the\r\n      first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of\r\n      the lighted window. The farther wall of the orchard was already\r\n      invisible, and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white\r\n      vapour. As we watched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round both\r\n      corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank on\r\n      which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship\r\n      upon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck his hand passionately upon the\r\n      rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf he isn\u2019t out in a quarter of an hour the path will be\r\n      covered. In half an hour we won\u2019t be able to see our hands in\r\n      front of us.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cShall we move farther back upon higher ground?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, I think it would be as well.\u201d\r\n\r\n      So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we\r\n      were half a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea,\r\n      with the moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and\r\n      inexorably on.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe are going too far,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWe dare not take the chance\r\n      of his being overtaken before he can reach us. At all costs we\r\n      must hold our ground where we are.\u201d He dropped on his knees and\r\n      clapped his ear to the ground. \u201cThank God, I think that I hear\r\n      him coming.\u201d\r\n\r\n      A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor. Crouching\r\n      among the stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank in\r\n      front of us. The steps grew louder, and through the fog, as\r\n      through a curtain, there stepped the man whom we were awaiting.\r\n      He looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear,\r\n      starlit night. Then he came swiftly along the path, passed close\r\n      to where we lay, and went on up the long slope behind us. As he\r\n      walked he glanced continually over either shoulder, like a man\r\n      who is ill at ease.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHist!\u201d cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking\r\n      pistol. \u201cLook out! It\u2019s coming!\u201d\r\n\r\n      There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in the\r\n      heart of that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards of\r\n      where we lay, and we glared at it, all three, uncertain what\r\n      horror was about to break from the heart of it. I was at Holmes\u2019s\r\n      elbow, and I glanced for an instant at his face. It was pale and\r\n      exultant, his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight. But\r\n      suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and his\r\n      lips parted in amazement. At the same instant Lestrade gave a\r\n      yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground. I\r\n      sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind\r\n      paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from\r\n      the shadows of the fog. A hound it was, an enormous coal-black\r\n      hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen. Fire\r\n      burst from its open mouth, its eyes glowed with a smouldering\r\n      glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in\r\n      flickering flame. Never in the delirious dream of a disordered\r\n      brain could anything more savage, more appalling, more hellish be\r\n      conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon us\r\n      out of the wall of fog.\r\n\r\n      With long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the\r\n      track, following hard upon the footsteps of our friend. So\r\n      paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass\r\n      before we had recovered our nerve. Then Holmes and I both fired\r\n      together, and the creature gave a hideous howl, which showed that\r\n      one at least had hit him. He did not pause, however, but bounded\r\n      onward. Far away on the path we saw Sir Henry looking back, his\r\n      face white in the moonlight, his hands raised in horror, glaring\r\n      helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down. But\r\n      that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the\r\n      winds. If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could wound\r\n      him we could kill him. Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran\r\n      that night. I am reckoned fleet of foot, but he outpaced me as\r\n      much as I outpaced the little professional. In front of us as we\r\n      flew up the track we heard scream after scream from Sir Henry and\r\n      the deep roar of the hound. I was in time to see the beast spring\r\n      upon its victim, hurl him to the ground, and worry at his throat.\r\n      But the next instant Holmes had emptied five barrels of his\r\n      revolver into the creature\u2019s flank. With a last howl of agony and\r\n      a vicious snap in the air, it rolled upon its back, four feet\r\n      pawing furiously, and then fell limp upon its side. I stooped,\r\n      panting, and pressed my pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head,\r\n      but it was useless to press the trigger. The giant hound was\r\n      dead.\r\n\r\n      Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away his\r\n      collar, and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw\r\n      that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in\r\n      time. Already our friend\u2019s eyelids shivered and he made a feeble\r\n      effort to move. Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between the\r\n      baronet\u2019s teeth, and two frightened eyes were looking up at us.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy God!\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhat was it? What, in heaven\u2019s name, was\r\n      it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s dead, whatever it is,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWe\u2019ve laid the family\r\n      ghost once and forever.\u201d\r\n\r\n      In mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was\r\n      lying stretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and it\r\n      was not a pure mastiff; but it appeared to be a combination of\r\n      the two\u2014gaunt, savage, and as large as a small lioness. Even now\r\n      in the stillness of death, the huge jaws seemed to be dripping\r\n      with a bluish flame and the small, deep-set, cruel eyes were\r\n      ringed with fire. I placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle, and\r\n      as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the\r\n      darkness.\r\n\r\n      \u201cPhosphorus,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n      \u201cA cunning preparation of it,\u201d said Holmes, sniffing at the dead\r\n      animal. \u201cThere is no smell which might have interfered with his\r\n      power of scent. We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for having\r\n      exposed you to this fright. I was prepared for a hound, but not\r\n      for such a creature as this. And the fog gave us little time to\r\n      receive him.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have saved my life.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHaving first endangered it. Are you strong enough to stand?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cGive me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for\r\n      anything. So! Now, if you will help me up. What do you propose to\r\n      do?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo leave you here. You are not fit for further adventures\r\n      tonight. If you will wait, one or other of us will go back with\r\n      you to the Hall.\u201d\r\n\r\n      He tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly pale\r\n      and trembling in every limb. We helped him to a rock, where he\r\n      sat shivering with his face buried in his hands.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe must leave you now,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThe rest of our work must\r\n      be done, and every moment is of importance. We have our case, and\r\n      now we only want our man.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s a thousand to one against our finding him at the house,\u201d he\r\n      continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. \u201cThose\r\n      shots must have told him that the game was up.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe followed the hound to call him off\u2014of that you may be\r\n      certain. No, no, he\u2019s gone by this time! But we\u2019ll search the\r\n      house and make sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room to\r\n      room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us\r\n      in the passage. There was no light save in the dining-room, but\r\n      Holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house\r\n      unexplored. No sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing.\r\n      On the upper floor, however, one of the bedroom doors was locked.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere\u2019s someone in here,\u201d cried Lestrade. \u201cI can hear a\r\n      movement. Open this door!\u201d\r\n\r\n      A faint moaning and rustling came from within. Holmes struck the\r\n      door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew\r\n      open. Pistol in hand, we all three rushed into the room.\r\n\r\n      But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant\r\n      villain whom we expected to see. Instead we were faced by an\r\n      object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment\r\n      staring at it in amazement.\r\n\r\n      The room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls\r\n      were lined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that\r\n      collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had\r\n      been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man. In the\r\n      centre of this room there was an upright beam, which had been\r\n      placed at some period as a support for the old worm-eaten baulk\r\n      of timber which spanned the roof. To this post a figure was tied,\r\n      so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to\r\n      secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was\r\n      that of a man or a woman. One towel passed round the throat and\r\n      was secured at the back of the pillar. Another covered the lower\r\n      part of the face, and over it two dark eyes\u2014eyes full of grief\r\n      and shame and a dreadful questioning\u2014stared back at us. In a\r\n      minute we had torn off the gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs.\r\n      Stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us. As her beautiful\r\n      head fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplash\r\n      across her neck.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe brute!\u201d cried Holmes. \u201cHere, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle!\r\n      Put her in the chair! She has fainted from ill-usage and\r\n      exhaustion.\u201d\r\n\r\n      She opened her eyes again.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs he safe?\u201d she asked. \u201cHas he escaped?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe cannot escape us, madam.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir Henry? Is he safe?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the hound?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is dead.\u201d\r\n\r\n      She gave a long sigh of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he has treated\r\n      me!\u201d She shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we saw with\r\n      horror that they were all mottled with bruises. \u201cBut this is\r\n      nothing\u2014nothing! It is my mind and soul that he has tortured and\r\n      defiled. I could endure it all, ill-usage, solitude, a life of\r\n      deception, everything, as long as I could still cling to the hope\r\n      that I had his love, but now I know that in this also I have been\r\n      his dupe and his tool.\u201d She broke into passionate sobbing as she\r\n      spoke.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou bear him no good will, madam,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cTell us then\r\n      where we shall find him. If you have ever aided him in evil, help\r\n      us now and so atone.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is but one place where he can have fled,\u201d she answered.\r\n      \u201cThere is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire.\r\n      It was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made\r\n      preparations so that he might have a refuge. That is where he\r\n      would fly.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held\r\n      the lamp towards it.\r\n\r\n      \u201cSee,\u201d said he. \u201cNo one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire\r\n      tonight.\u201d\r\n\r\n      She laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed\r\n      with fierce merriment.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe may find his way in, but never out,\u201d she cried. \u201cHow can he\r\n      see the guiding wands tonight? We planted them together, he and\r\n      I, to mark the pathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only have\r\n      plucked them out today. Then indeed you would have had him at\r\n      your mercy!\u201d\r\n\r\n      It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog\r\n      had lifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house\r\n      while Holmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville\r\n      Hall. The story of the Stapletons could no longer be withheld\r\n      from him, but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth\r\n      about the woman whom he had loved. But the shock of the night\u2019s\r\n      adventures had shattered his nerves, and before morning he lay\r\n      delirious in a high fever under the care of Dr. Mortimer. The two\r\n      of them were destined to travel together round the world before\r\n      Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he had\r\n      been before he became master of that ill-omened estate.\r\n\r\n      And now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular\r\n      narrative, in which I have tried to make the reader share those\r\n      dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and\r\n      ended in so tragic a manner. On the morning after the death of\r\n      the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by Mrs. Stapleton\r\n      to the point where they had found a pathway through the bog. It\r\n      helped us to realise the horror of this woman\u2019s life when we saw\r\n      the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband\u2019s\r\n      track. We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm,\r\n      peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. From the\r\n      end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the\r\n      path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those\r\n      green-scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the\r\n      stranger. Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour\r\n      of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces, while a\r\n      false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark,\r\n      quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around\r\n      our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked,\r\n      and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was\r\n      tugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful\r\n      was the clutch in which it held us. Once only we saw a trace that\r\n      someone had passed that perilous way before us. From amid a tuft\r\n      of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing\r\n      was projecting. Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the\r\n      path to seize it, and had we not been there to drag him out he\r\n      could never have set his foot upon firm land again. He held an\r\n      old black boot in the air. \u201cMeyers, Toronto,\u201d was printed on the\r\n      leather inside.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is worth a mud bath,\u201d said he. \u201cIt is our friend Sir Henry\u2019s\r\n      missing boot.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThrown there by Stapleton in his flight.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly. He retained it in his hand after using it to set the\r\n      hound upon the track. He fled when he knew the game was up, still\r\n      clutching it. And he hurled it away at this point of his flight.\r\n      We know at least that he came so far in safety.\u201d\r\n\r\n      But more than that we were never destined to know, though there\r\n      was much which we might surmise. There was no chance of finding\r\n      footsteps in the mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon\r\n      them, but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass\r\n      we all looked eagerly for them. But no slightest sign of them\r\n      ever met our eyes. If the earth told a true story, then Stapleton\r\n      never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled\r\n      through the fog upon that last night. Somewhere in the heart of\r\n      the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the huge morass\r\n      which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is\r\n      forever buried.\r\n\r\n      Many traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he had\r\n      hid his savage ally. A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled\r\n      with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine. Beside it\r\n      were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners, driven\r\n      away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp. In one\r\n      of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones\r\n      showed where the animal had been confined. A skeleton with a\r\n      tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the _d\u00e9bris_.\r\n\r\n      \u201cA dog!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cBy Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor\r\n      Mortimer will never see his pet again. Well, I do not know that\r\n      this place contains any secret which we have not already\r\n      fathomed. He could hide his hound, but he could not hush its\r\n      voice, and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not\r\n      pleasant to hear. On an emergency he could keep the hound in the\r\n      out-house at Merripit, but it was always a risk, and it was only\r\n      on the supreme day, which he regarded as the end of all his\r\n      efforts, that he dared do it. This paste in the tin is no doubt\r\n      the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed. It was\r\n      suggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, and\r\n      by the desire to frighten old Sir Charles to death. No wonder the\r\n      poor devil of a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did,\r\n      and as we ourselves might have done, when he saw such a creature\r\n      bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track. It was\r\n      a cunning device, for, apart from the chance of driving your\r\n      victim to his death, what peasant would venture to inquire too\r\n      closely into such a creature should he get sight of it, as many\r\n      have done, upon the moor? I said it in London, Watson, and I say\r\n      it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more\r\n      dangerous man than he who is lying yonder\u201d\u2014he swept his long arm\r\n      towards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which\r\n      stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the\r\n      moor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15.\r\nA Retrospection\r\n\r\n\r\n      It was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and\r\n      foggy night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room\r\n      in Baker Street. Since the tragic upshot of our visit to\r\n      Devonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost\r\n      importance, in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious\r\n      conduct of Colonel Upwood in connection with the famous card\r\n      scandal of the Nonpareil Club, while in the second he had\r\n      defended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier from the charge of\r\n      murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her\r\n      step-daughter, Mlle. Car\u00e9re, the young lady who, as it will be\r\n      remembered, was found six months later alive and married in New\r\n      York. My friend was in excellent spirits over the success which\r\n      had attended a succession of difficult and important cases, so\r\n      that I was able to induce him to discuss the details of the\r\n      Baskerville mystery. I had waited patiently for the opportunity\r\n      for I was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap, and\r\n      that his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its\r\n      present work to dwell upon memories of the past. Sir Henry and\r\n      Dr. Mortimer were, however, in London, on their way to that long\r\n      voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his\r\n      shattered nerves. They had called upon us that very afternoon, so\r\n      that it was natural that the subject should come up for\r\n      discussion.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe whole course of events,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cfrom the point of\r\n      view of the man who called himself Stapleton was simple and\r\n      direct, although to us, who had no means in the beginning of\r\n      knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of\r\n      the facts, it all appeared exceedingly complex. I have had the\r\n      advantage of two conversations with Mrs. Stapleton, and the case\r\n      has now been so entirely cleared up that I am not aware that\r\n      there is anything which has remained a secret to us. You will\r\n      find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my\r\n      indexed list of cases.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of\r\n      events from memory.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cCertainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts\r\n      in my mind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way of\r\n      blotting out what has passed. The barrister who has his case at\r\n      his fingers\u2019 ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his\r\n      own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it\r\n      all out of his head once more. So each of my cases displaces the\r\n      last, and Mlle. Car\u00e9re has blurred my recollection of Baskerville\r\n      Hall. Tomorrow some other little problem may be submitted to my\r\n      notice which will in turn dispossess the fair French lady and the\r\n      infamous Upwood. So far as the case of the hound goes, however, I\r\n      will give you the course of events as nearly as I can, and you\r\n      will suggest anything which I may have forgotten.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait\r\n      did not lie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville. He\r\n      was a son of that Rodger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir\r\n      Charles, who fled with a sinister reputation to South America,\r\n      where he was said to have died unmarried. He did, as a matter of\r\n      fact, marry, and had one child, this fellow, whose real name is\r\n      the same as his father\u2019s. He married Beryl Garcia, one of the\r\n      beauties of Costa Rica, and, having purloined a considerable sum\r\n      of public money, he changed his name to Vandeleur and fled to\r\n      England, where he established a school in the east of Yorkshire.\r\n      His reason for attempting this special line of business was that\r\n      he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon\r\n      the voyage home, and that he had used this man\u2019s ability to make\r\n      the undertaking a success. Fraser, the tutor, died however, and\r\n      the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy.\r\n      The Vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to\r\n      Stapleton, and he brought the remains of his fortune, his schemes\r\n      for the future, and his taste for entomology to the south of\r\n      England. I learned at the British Museum that he was a recognized\r\n      authority upon the subject, and that the name of Vandeleur has\r\n      been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had, in his\r\n      Yorkshire days, been the first to describe.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be\r\n      of such intense interest to us. The fellow had evidently made\r\n      inquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him and\r\n      a valuable estate. When he went to Devonshire his plans were, I\r\n      believe, exceedingly hazy, but that he meant mischief from the\r\n      first is evident from the way in which he took his wife with him\r\n      in the character of his sister. The idea of using her as a decoy\r\n      was clearly already in his mind, though he may not have been\r\n      certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged. He meant\r\n      in the end to have the estate, and he was ready to use any tool\r\n      or run any risk for that end. His first act was to establish\r\n      himself as near to his ancestral home as he could, and his second\r\n      was to cultivate a friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville and\r\n      with the neighbours.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so\r\n      prepared the way for his own death. Stapleton, as I will continue\r\n      to call him, knew that the old man\u2019s heart was weak and that a\r\n      shock would kill him. So much he had learned from Dr. Mortimer.\r\n      He had heard also that Sir Charles was superstitious and had\r\n      taken this grim legend very seriously. His ingenious mind\r\n      instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could be done to\r\n      death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the\r\n      guilt to the real murderer.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHaving conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with\r\n      considerable finesse. An ordinary schemer would have been content\r\n      to work with a savage hound. The use of artificial means to make\r\n      the creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part. The\r\n      dog he bought in London from Ross and Mangles, the dealers in\r\n      Fulham Road. It was the strongest and most savage in their\r\n      possession. He brought it down by the North Devon line and walked\r\n      a great distance over the moor so as to get it home without\r\n      exciting any remarks. He had already on his insect hunts learned\r\n      to penetrate the Grimpen Mire, and so had found a safe\r\n      hiding-place for the creature. Here he kennelled it and waited\r\n      his chance.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut it was some time coming. The old gentleman could not be\r\n      decoyed outside of his grounds at night. Several times Stapleton\r\n      lurked about with his hound, but without avail. It was during\r\n      these fruitless quests that he, or rather his ally, was seen by\r\n      peasants, and that the legend of the demon dog received a new\r\n      confirmation. He had hoped that his wife might lure Sir Charles\r\n      to his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly independent. She\r\n      would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a\r\n      sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy.\r\n      Threats and even, I am sorry to say, blows refused to move her.\r\n      She would have nothing to do with it, and for a time Stapleton\r\n      was at a deadlock.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that\r\n      Sir Charles, who had conceived a friendship for him, made him the\r\n      minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman,\r\n      Mrs. Laura Lyons. By representing himself as a single man he\r\n      acquired complete influence over her, and he gave her to\r\n      understand that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her\r\n      husband he would marry her. His plans were suddenly brought to a\r\n      head by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about to leave the\r\n      Hall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer, with whose opinion he himself\r\n      pretended to coincide. He must act at once, or his victim might\r\n      get beyond his power. He therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons\r\n      to write this letter, imploring the old man to give her an\r\n      interview on the evening before his departure for London. He\r\n      then, by a specious argument, prevented her from going, and so\r\n      had the chance for which he had waited.\r\n\r\n      \u201cDriving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in time to\r\n      get his hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to bring\r\n      the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that\r\n      he would find the old gentleman waiting. The dog, incited by its\r\n      master, sprang over the wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate\r\n      baronet, who fled screaming down the yew alley. In that gloomy\r\n      tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge\r\n      black creature, with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes, bounding\r\n      after its victim. He fell dead at the end of the alley from heart\r\n      disease and terror. The hound had kept upon the grassy border\r\n      while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track but the\r\n      man\u2019s was visible. On seeing him lying still the creature had\r\n      probably approached to sniff at him, but finding him dead had\r\n      turned away again. It was then that it left the print which was\r\n      actually observed by Dr. Mortimer. The hound was called off and\r\n      hurried away to its lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was\r\n      left which puzzled the authorities, alarmed the countryside, and\r\n      finally brought the case within the scope of our observation.\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. You perceive\r\n      the devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost\r\n      impossible to make a case against the real murderer. His only\r\n      accomplice was one who could never give him away, and the\r\n      grotesque, inconceivable nature of the device only served to make\r\n      it more effective. Both of the women concerned in the case, Mrs.\r\n      Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left with a strong suspicion\r\n      against Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that he had designs upon\r\n      the old man, and also of the existence of the hound. Mrs. Lyons\r\n      knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the death\r\n      occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was\r\n      only known to him. However, both of them were under his\r\n      influence, and he had nothing to fear from them. The first half\r\n      of his task was successfully accomplished but the more difficult\r\n      still remained.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of\r\n      an heir in Canada. In any case he would very soon learn it from\r\n      his friend Dr. Mortimer, and he was told by the latter all\r\n      details about the arrival of Henry Baskerville. Stapleton\u2019s first\r\n      idea was that this young stranger from Canada might possibly be\r\n      done to death in London without coming down to Devonshire at all.\r\n      He distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in\r\n      laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not leave her long\r\n      out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her.\r\n      It was for this reason that he took her to London with him. They\r\n      lodged, I find, at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in Craven\r\n      Street, which was actually one of those called upon by my agent\r\n      in search of evidence. Here he kept his wife imprisoned in her\r\n      room while he, disguised in a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer to\r\n      Baker Street and afterwards to the station and to the\r\n      Northumberland Hotel. His wife had some inkling of his plans; but\r\n      she had such a fear of her husband\u2014a fear founded upon brutal\r\n      ill-treatment\u2014that she dare not write to warn the man whom she\r\n      knew to be in danger. If the letter should fall into Stapleton\u2019s\r\n      hands her own life would not be safe. Eventually, as we know, she\r\n      adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form\r\n      the message, and addressing the letter in a disguised hand. It\r\n      reached the baronet, and gave him the first warning of his\r\n      danger.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir\r\n      Henry\u2019s attire so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, he\r\n      might always have the means of setting him upon his track. With\r\n      characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once,\r\n      and we cannot doubt that the boots or chamber-maid of the hotel\r\n      was well bribed to help him in his design. By chance, however,\r\n      the first boot which was procured for him was a new one and,\r\n      therefore, useless for his purpose. He then had it returned and\r\n      obtained another\u2014a most instructive incident, since it proved\r\n      conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound,\r\n      as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an\r\n      old boot and this indifference to a new one. The more _outr\u00e9_ and\r\n      grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be\r\n      examined, and the very point which appears to complicate a case\r\n      is, when duly considered and scientifically handled, the one\r\n      which is most likely to elucidate it.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen we had the visit from our friends next morning, shadowed\r\n      always by Stapleton in the cab. From his knowledge of our rooms\r\n      and of my appearance, as well as from his general conduct, I am\r\n      inclined to think that Stapleton\u2019s career of crime has been by no\r\n      means limited to this single Baskerville affair. It is suggestive\r\n      that during the last three years there have been four\r\n      considerable burglaries in the west country, for none of which\r\n      was any criminal ever arrested. The last of these, at Folkestone\r\n      Court, in May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling of\r\n      the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. I cannot\r\n      doubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources in this\r\n      fashion, and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous\r\n      man.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when\r\n      he got away from us so successfully, and also of his audacity in\r\n      sending back my own name to me through the cabman. From that\r\n      moment he understood that I had taken over the case in London,\r\n      and that therefore there was no chance for him there. He returned\r\n      to Dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOne moment!\u201d said I. \u201cYou have, no doubt, described the sequence\r\n      of events correctly, but there is one point which you have left\r\n      unexplained. What became of the hound when its master was in\r\n      London?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly\r\n      of importance. There can be no question that Stapleton had a\r\n      confidant, though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in\r\n      his power by sharing all his plans with him. There was an old\r\n      manservant at Merripit House, whose name was Anthony. His\r\n      connection with the Stapletons can be traced for several years,\r\n      as far back as the school-mastering days, so that he must have\r\n      been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and\r\n      wife. This man has disappeared and has escaped from the country.\r\n      It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in England,\r\n      while Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-American countries.\r\n      The man, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but\r\n      with a curious lisping accent. I have myself seen this old man\r\n      cross the Grimpen Mire by the path which Stapleton had marked\r\n      out. It is very probable, therefore, that in the absence of his\r\n      master it was he who cared for the hound, though he may never\r\n      have known the purpose for which the beast was used.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Stapletons then went down to Devonshire, whither they were\r\n      soon followed by Sir Henry and you. One word now as to how I\r\n      stood myself at that time. It may possibly recur to your memory\r\n      that when I examined the paper upon which the printed words were\r\n      fastened I made a close inspection for the water-mark. In doing\r\n      so I held it within a few inches of my eyes, and was conscious of\r\n      a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine. There are\r\n      seventy-five perfumes, which it is very necessary that a criminal\r\n      expert should be able to distinguish from each other, and cases\r\n      have more than once within my own experience depended upon their\r\n      prompt recognition. The scent suggested the presence of a lady,\r\n      and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons.\r\n      Thus I had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at the\r\n      criminal before ever we went to the west country.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was my game to watch Stapleton. It was evident, however, that\r\n      I could not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenly\r\n      on his guard. I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included,\r\n      and I came down secretly when I was supposed to be in London. My\r\n      hardships were not so great as you imagined, though such trifling\r\n      details must never interfere with the investigation of a case. I\r\n      stayed for the most part at Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut\r\n      upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of\r\n      action. Cartwright had come down with me, and in his disguise as\r\n      a country boy he was of great assistance to me. I was dependent\r\n      upon him for food and clean linen. When I was watching Stapleton,\r\n      Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that I was able to\r\n      keep my hand upon all the strings.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly,\r\n      being forwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey.\r\n      They were of great service to me, and especially that one\r\n      incidentally truthful piece of biography of Stapleton\u2019s. I was\r\n      able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew\r\n      at last exactly how I stood. The case had been considerably\r\n      complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and the\r\n      relations between him and the Barrymores. This also you cleared\r\n      up in a very effective way, though I had already come to the same\r\n      conclusions from my own observations.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBy the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a\r\n      complete knowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case\r\n      which could go to a jury. Even Stapleton\u2019s attempt upon Sir Henry\r\n      that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict\r\n      did not help us much in proving murder against our man. There\r\n      seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red-handed, and to\r\n      do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and apparently unprotected,\r\n      as a bait. We did so, and at the cost of a severe shock to our\r\n      client we succeeded in completing our case and driving Stapleton\r\n      to his destruction. That Sir Henry should have been exposed to\r\n      this is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the case,\r\n      but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing\r\n      spectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog\r\n      which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice. We\r\n      succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and\r\n      Dr. Mortimer assure me will be a temporary one. A long journey\r\n      may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered\r\n      nerves but also from his wounded feelings. His love for the lady\r\n      was deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part of all this\r\n      black business was that he should have been deceived by her.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt only remains to indicate the part which she had played\r\n      throughout. There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an\r\n      influence over her which may have been love or may have been\r\n      fear, or very possibly both, since they are by no means\r\n      incompatible emotions. It was, at least, absolutely effective. At\r\n      his command she consented to pass as his sister, though he found\r\n      the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her\r\n      the direct accessory to murder. She was ready to warn Sir Henry\r\n      so far as she could without implicating her husband, and again\r\n      and again she tried to do so. Stapleton himself seems to have\r\n      been capable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying\r\n      court to the lady, even though it was part of his own plan, still\r\n      he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which\r\n      revealed the fiery soul which his self-contained manner so\r\n      cleverly concealed. By encouraging the intimacy he made it\r\n      certain that Sir Henry would frequently come to Merripit House\r\n      and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he\r\n      desired. On the day of the crisis, however, his wife turned\r\n      suddenly against him. She had learned something of the death of\r\n      the convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the\r\n      outhouse on the evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner. She\r\n      taxed her husband with his intended crime, and a furious scene\r\n      followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had a\r\n      rival in his love. Her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter\r\n      hatred, and he saw that she would betray him. He tied her up,\r\n      therefore, that she might have no chance of warning Sir Henry,\r\n      and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put down\r\n      the baronet\u2019s death to the curse of his family, as they certainly\r\n      would do, he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished\r\n      fact and to keep silent upon what she knew. In this I fancy that\r\n      in any case he made a miscalculation, and that, if we had not\r\n      been there, his doom would none the less have been sealed. A\r\n      woman of Spanish blood does not condone such an injury so\r\n      lightly. And now, my dear Watson, without referring to my notes,\r\n      I cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case. I\r\n      do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had done\r\n      the old uncle with his bogie hound.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe beast was savage and half-starved. If its appearance did not\r\n      frighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyze the\r\n      resistance which might be offered.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo doubt. There only remains one difficulty. If Stapleton came\r\n      into the succession, how could he explain the fact that he, the\r\n      heir, had been living unannounced under another name so close to\r\n      the property? How could he claim it without causing suspicion and\r\n      inquiry?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is a formidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much\r\n      when you expect me to solve it. The past and the present are\r\n      within the field of my inquiry, but what a man may do in the\r\n      future is a hard question to answer. Mrs. Stapleton has heard her\r\n      husband discuss the problem on several occasions. There were\r\n      three possible courses. He might claim the property from South\r\n      America, establish his identity before the British authorities\r\n      there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to England at\r\n      all, or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short\r\n      time that he need be in London; or, again, he might furnish an\r\n      accomplice with the proofs and papers, putting him in as heir,\r\n      and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income. We\r\n      cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have found\r\n      some way out of the difficulty. And now, my dear Watson, we have\r\n      had some weeks of severe work, and for one evening, I think, we\r\n      may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels. I have a box\r\n      for _Les Huguenots_. Have you heard the De Reszkes? Might I\r\n      trouble you then to be ready in half an hour, and we can stop at\r\n      Marcini\u2019s for a little dinner on the way?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES ***\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nTo Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him\r\nmention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\r\npredominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\r\nakin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\r\nwere abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He\r\nwas, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\r\nthe world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\r\nfalse position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\r\nand a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer\u2014excellent for\r\ndrawing the veil from men\u2019s motives and actions. But for the trained\r\nreasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\r\nadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\r\nthrow a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\r\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\r\nbe more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\r\nyet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\r\nAdler, of dubious and questionable memory.\r\n\r\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\r\nfrom each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\r\ninterests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\r\nof his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\r\nwhile Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian\r\nsoul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\r\nbooks, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\r\nthe drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\r\nnature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\r\nand occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\r\nobservation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\r\nmysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\r\nFrom time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\r\nsummons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\r\nof the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\r\nfinally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\r\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\r\nhis activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\r\nthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\r\n\r\nOne night\u2014it was on the twentieth of March, 1888\u2014I was returning from a\r\njourney to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\r\nmy way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\r\ndoor, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\r\nwith the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\r\nkeen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\r\nextraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\r\nlooked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\r\nagainst the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\r\nhead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\r\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\r\nstory. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\r\ndreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\r\nand was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\r\n\r\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\r\nto see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\r\nme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\r\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\r\nand looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWedlock suits you,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think, Watson, that you have put\r\non seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSeven!\u201d I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\r\nfancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\r\nthat you intended to go into harness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, how do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\r\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\r\nservant girl?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Holmes,\u201d said I, \u201cthis is too much. You would certainly have\r\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\r\ncountry walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\r\nhave changed my clothes I can\u2019t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\r\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\r\nagain, I fail to see how you work it out.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is simplicity itself,\u201d said he; \u201cmy eyes tell me that on the inside\r\nof your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\r\nscored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\r\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\r\norder to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double\r\ndeduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\r\nparticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As\r\nto your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\r\niodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\r\nforefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\r\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\r\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\r\nprocess of deduction. \u201cWhen I hear you give your reasons,\u201d I remarked,\r\n\u201cthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\r\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\r\nreasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I\r\nbelieve that my eyes are as good as yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so,\u201d he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\r\ndown into an armchair. \u201cYou see, but you do not observe. The\r\ndistinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\r\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrequently.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow often?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, some hundreds of times.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen how many are there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow many? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\r\nmy point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\r\nboth seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these\r\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\r\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\u201d He threw\r\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\r\nupon the table. \u201cIt came by the last post,\u201d said he. \u201cRead it aloud.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\u2019clock,\u201d it\r\nsaid, \u201ca gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\r\ndeepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\r\nEurope have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\r\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\r\nThis account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\r\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\r\nwear a mask.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is indeed a mystery,\u201d I remarked. \u201cWhat do you imagine that it\r\nmeans?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\r\ndata. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\r\ntheories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\r\nit?\u201d\r\n\r\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\u201d I remarked,\r\nendeavouring to imitate my companion\u2019s processes. \u201cSuch paper could not\r\nbe bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\r\nstiff.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPeculiar\u2014that is the very word,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt is not an English\r\npaper at all. Hold it up to the light.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did so, and saw a large \u201cE\u201d with a small \u201cg,\u201d a \u201cP,\u201d and a large \u201cG\u201d\r\nwith a small \u201ct\u201d woven into the texture of the paper.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you make of that?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. The \u2018G\u2019 with the small \u2018t\u2019 stands for \u2018Gesellschaft,\u2019\r\nwhich is the German for \u2018Company.\u2019 It is a customary contraction like\r\nour \u2018Co.\u2019 \u2018P,\u2019 of course, stands for \u2018Papier.\u2019 Now for the \u2018Eg.\u2019 Let us\r\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.\u201d He took down a heavy brown volume\r\nfrom his shelves. \u201cEglow, Eglonitz\u2014here we are, Egria. It is in a\r\nGerman-speaking country\u2014in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. \u2018Remarkable\r\nas being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\r\nglass-factories and paper-mills.\u2019 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\r\nthat?\u201d His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\r\nfrom his cigarette.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe paper was made in Bohemia,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\r\npeculiar construction of the sentence\u2014\u2018This account of you we have from\r\nall quarters received.\u2019 A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\r\nthat. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\r\nremains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\r\nwrites upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\r\nface. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\r\ndoubts.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\u2019 hoofs and grating\r\nwheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\r\nwhistled.\r\n\r\n\u201cA pair, by the sound,\u201d said he. \u201cYes,\u201d he continued, glancing out of\r\nthe window. \u201cA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\r\nand fifty guineas apiece. There\u2019s money in this case, Watson, if there\r\nis nothing else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I had better go, Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\r\nAnd this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut your client\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\r\nSit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\u201d\r\n\r\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\r\npassage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\r\nauthoritative tap.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\r\nin height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\r\nwith a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\r\ntaste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\r\nfronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\r\nthrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\r\nsecured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\r\nberyl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\r\ntrimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\r\nbarbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\r\ncarried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\r\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\r\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\r\nwas still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\r\nhe appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\r\nand a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\r\nof obstinacy.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou had my note?\u201d he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\r\nmarked German accent. \u201cI told you that I would call.\u201d He looked from\r\none to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\r\n\r\n\u201cPray take a seat,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis is my friend and colleague, Dr.\r\nWatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\r\nhave I the honour to address?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\r\nunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\r\ndiscretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\r\nimportance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you\r\nalone.\u201d\r\n\r\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\r\nmy chair. \u201cIt is both, or none,\u201d said he. \u201cYou may say before this\r\ngentleman anything which you may say to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cThen I must begin,\u201d said he,\r\n\u201cby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\r\nthat time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too\r\nmuch to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\r\nEuropean history.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI promise,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse this mask,\u201d continued our strange visitor. \u201cThe august\r\nperson who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\r\nconfess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\r\nnot exactly my own.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was aware of it,\u201d said Holmes dryly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to\r\nbe taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\r\nseriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak\r\nplainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\r\nkings of Bohemia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was also aware of that,\u201d murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\r\nhis armchair and closing his eyes.\r\n\r\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\r\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the\r\nmost incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\r\nslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\u201d he remarked, \u201cI\r\nshould be better able to advise you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\r\nuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\r\nthe mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \u201cYou are right,\u201d\r\nhe cried; \u201cI am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, indeed?\u201d murmured Holmes. \u201cYour Majesty had not spoken before I\r\nwas aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\r\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of\r\nBohemia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you can understand,\u201d said our strange visitor, sitting down once\r\nmore and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \u201cyou can\r\nunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own\r\nperson. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to\r\nan agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_\r\nfrom Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, pray consult,\u201d said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy\r\nvisit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,\r\nIrene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\u201d murmured Holmes without\r\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing\r\nall paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to\r\nname a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish\r\ninformation. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between\r\nthat of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a\r\nmonograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.\r\nContralto\u2014hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw\u2014yes!\r\nRetired from operatic stage\u2014ha! Living in London\u2014quite so! Your\r\nMajesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person,\r\nwrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting\r\nthose letters back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so. But how\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas there a secret marriage?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo legal papers or certificates?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should\r\nproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\r\nprove their authenticity?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is the writing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPooh, pooh! Forgery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy private note-paper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStolen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy own seal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImitated.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBought.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were both in the photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\r\nindiscretion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was mad\u2014insane.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have compromised yourself seriously.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be recovered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have tried and failed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe will not sell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStolen, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFive attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her\r\nhouse. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has\r\nbeen waylaid. There has been no result.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo sign of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely none.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed. \u201cIt is quite a pretty little problem,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut a very serious one to me,\u201d returned the King reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo ruin me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am about to be married.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I have heard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\r\nScandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is\r\nherself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct\r\nwould bring the matter to an end.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Irene Adler?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThreatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that\r\nshe will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She\r\nhas the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most\r\nresolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no\r\nlengths to which she would not go\u2014none.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure that she has not sent it yet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause she has said that she would send it on the day when the\r\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, then we have three days yet,\u201d said Holmes with a yawn. \u201cThat is\r\nvery fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into\r\njust at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the\r\npresent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count\r\nVon Kramm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, as to money?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have _carte blanche_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to\r\nhave that photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd for present expenses?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid\r\nit on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,\u201d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Mademoiselle\u2019s address?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John\u2019s Wood.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes took a note of it. \u201cOne other question,\u201d said he. \u201cWas the\r\nphotograph a cabinet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have\r\nsome good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\u201d he added, as the\r\nwheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \u201cIf you will be\r\ngood enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o\u2019clock I should like\r\nto chat this little matter over with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAt three o\u2019clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not\r\nyet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house\r\nshortly after eight o\u2019clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire,\r\nhowever, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.\r\nI was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was\r\nsurrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were\r\nassociated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still,\r\nthe nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a\r\ncharacter of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\r\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\r\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which\r\nmade it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\r\nquick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable\r\nmysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very\r\npossibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\r\n\r\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\r\ngroom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\r\ndisreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my\r\nfriend\u2019s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three\r\ntimes before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he\r\nvanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes\r\ntweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his\r\npockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed\r\nheartily for some minutes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, really!\u201d he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he\r\nwas obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed\r\nmy morning, or what I ended by doing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and\r\nperhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.\r\nI left the house a little after eight o\u2019clock this morning in the\r\ncharacter of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and\r\nfreemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all\r\nthat there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_\r\nvilla, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to\r\nthe road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on\r\nthe right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,\r\nand those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could\r\nopen. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\r\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and\r\nexamined it closely from every point of view, but without noting\r\nanything else of interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cI then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there\r\nwas a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent\r\nthe ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in\r\nexchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,\r\nand as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say\r\nnothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was\r\nnot in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to\r\nlisten to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what of Irene Adler?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, she has turned all the men\u2019s heads down in that part. She is the\r\ndaintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the\r\nSerpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\r\nout at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom\r\ngoes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male\r\nvisitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,\r\nnever calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey\r\nNorton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a\r\nconfidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,\r\nand knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I\r\nbegan to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think\r\nover my plan of campaign.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.\r\nHe was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between\r\nthem, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client,\r\nhis friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably\r\ntransferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less\r\nlikely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should\r\ncontinue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the\r\ngentleman\u2019s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it\r\nwidened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\r\ndetails, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are\r\nto understand the situation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am following you closely,\u201d I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up\r\nto Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably\r\nhandsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached\u2014evidently the man of whom\r\nI had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman\r\nto wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of\r\na man who was thoroughly at home.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of\r\nhim in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking\r\nexcitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently\r\nhe emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to\r\nthe cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it\r\nearnestly, \u2018Drive like the devil,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018first to Gross &\r\nHankey\u2019s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the\r\nEdgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAway they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well\r\nto follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman\r\nwith his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all\r\nthe tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn\u2019t\r\npulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only\r\ncaught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with\r\na face that a man might die for.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The Church of St. Monica, John,\u2019 she cried, \u2018and half a sovereign if\r\nyou reach it in twenty minutes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThis was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether\r\nI should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a\r\ncab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby\r\nfare, but I jumped in before he could object. \u2018The Church of St.\r\nMonica,\u2019 said I, \u2018and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty\r\nminutes.\u2019 It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was\r\nclear enough what was in the wind.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy cabby drove fast. I don\u2019t think I ever drove faster, but the others\r\nwere there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses\r\nwere in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried\r\ninto the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had\r\nfollowed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with\r\nthem. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I\r\nlounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a\r\nchurch. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\r\nme, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Thank God,\u2019 he cried. \u2018You\u2019ll do. Come! Come!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What then?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\u2019t be legal.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I\r\nfound myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and\r\nvouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in\r\nthe secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,\r\nbachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman\r\nthanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the\r\nclergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position\r\nin which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it\r\nthat started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some\r\ninformality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused\r\nto marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky\r\nappearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the\r\nstreets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I\r\nmean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\u201d said I; \u201cand what then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the\r\npair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt\r\nand energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they\r\nseparated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. \u2018I\r\nshall drive out in the park at five as usual,\u2019 she said as she left\r\nhim. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I\r\nwent off to make my own arrangements.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich are?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome cold beef and a glass of beer,\u201d he answered, ringing the bell. \u201cI\r\nhave been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still\r\nthis evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be delighted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind breaking the law?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in the least.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor running a chance of arrest?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in a good cause.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, the cause is excellent!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I am your man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was sure that I might rely on you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what is it you wish?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.\r\nNow,\u201d he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our\r\nlandlady had provided, \u201cI must discuss it while I eat, for I have not\r\nmuch time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene\r\nof action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at\r\nseven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.\r\nThere is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere,\r\ncome what may. You understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am to be neutral?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small\r\nunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed\r\ninto the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window\r\nwill open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd when I raise my hand\u2014so\u2014you will throw into the room what I give\r\nyou to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You\r\nquite follow me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEntirely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is nothing very formidable,\u201d he said, taking a long cigar-shaped\r\nroll from his pocket. \u201cIt is an ordinary plumber\u2019s smoke-rocket, fitted\r\nwith a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is\r\nconfined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up\r\nby quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the\r\nstreet, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made\r\nmyself clear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at\r\nthe signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and\r\nto wait you at the corner of the street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you may entirely rely on me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare\r\nfor the new role I have to play.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the\r\ncharacter of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His\r\nbroad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic\r\nsmile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such\r\nas Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that\r\nHolmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul\r\nseemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a\r\nfine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a\r\nspecialist in crime.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still\r\nwanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine\r\nAvenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as\r\nwe paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming\r\nof its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from\r\nSherlock Holmes\u2019 succinct description, but the locality appeared to be\r\nless private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a\r\nquiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of\r\nshabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a\r\nscissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a\r\nnurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and\r\ndown with cigars in their mouths.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\r\nhouse, \u201cthis marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes\r\na double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse\r\nto its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming\r\nto the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find\r\nthe photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere, indeed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\r\nsize. Too large for easy concealment about a woman\u2019s dress. She knows\r\nthat the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two\r\nattempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that\r\nshe does not carry it about with her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHer banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\r\ninclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like\r\nto do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?\r\nShe could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what\r\nindirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\r\nbusiness man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within\r\na few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be\r\nin her own house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it has twice been burgled.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPshaw! They did not know how to look.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how will you look?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not look.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will get her to show me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut she will refuse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her\r\ncarriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the\r\ncurve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to\r\nthe door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at\r\nthe corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a\r\ncopper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with\r\nthe same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by\r\nthe two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the\r\nscissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was\r\nstruck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,\r\nwas the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\r\nstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes\r\ndashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,\r\nhe gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely\r\ndown his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one\r\ndirection and the loungers in the other, while a number of better\r\ndressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\r\ncrowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene\r\nAdler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she\r\nstood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\r\nthe hall, looking back into the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs the poor gentleman much hurt?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is dead,\u201d cried several voices.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, there\u2019s life in him!\u201d shouted another. \u201cBut he\u2019ll be gone\r\nbefore you can get him to hospital.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a brave fellow,\u201d said a woman. \u201cThey would have had the lady\u2019s\r\npurse and watch if it hadn\u2019t been for him. They were a gang, and a\r\nrough one, too. Ah, he\u2019s breathing now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe can\u2019t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.\r\nThis way, please!\u201d\r\n\r\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\r\nprincipal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by\r\nthe window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,\r\nso that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know\r\nwhether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he\r\nwas playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of\r\nmyself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I\r\nwas conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon\r\nthe injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes\r\nto draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened\r\nmy heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I\r\nthought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from\r\ninjuring another.\r\n\r\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who\r\nis in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At\r\nthe same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my\r\nrocket into the room with a cry of \u201cFire!\u201d The word was no sooner out\r\nof my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\r\nill\u2014gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids\u2014joined in a general shriek of\r\n\u201cFire!\u201d Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the\r\nopen window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later\r\nthe voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false\r\nalarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\r\nof the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend\u2019s arm\r\nin mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly\r\nand in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the\r\nquiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did it very nicely, Doctor,\u201d he remarked. \u201cNothing could have been\r\nbetter. It is all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have the photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know where it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did you find out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe showed me, as I told you she would.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am still in the dark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not wish to make a mystery,\u201d said he, laughing. \u201cThe matter was\r\nperfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was\r\nan accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guessed as much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the\r\npalm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my\r\nface, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat also I could fathom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\r\nshe do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\r\nsuspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to\r\nsee which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were\r\ncompelled to open the window, and you had your chance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did that help you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\r\nher instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It\r\nis a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\r\nadvantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it\r\nwas of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married\r\nwoman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\r\nNow it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\r\nmore precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\r\nsecure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting\r\nwere enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\r\nphotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\r\nbell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as\r\nshe half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\r\nreplaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have\r\nnot seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\r\nhouse. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\r\nbut the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\r\nseemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King\r\nto-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown\r\ninto the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that\r\nwhen she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be\r\na satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd when will you call?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a\r\nclear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a\r\ncomplete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without\r\ndelay.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was\r\nsearching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\r\nappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that voice before,\u201d said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit\r\nstreet. \u201cNow, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast\r\nand coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have really got it!\u201d he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either\r\nshoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you have hopes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have hopes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must have a cab.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my brougham is waiting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen that will simplify matters.\u201d We descended and started off once\r\nmore for Briony Lodge.\r\n\r\n\u201cIrene Adler is married,\u201d remarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cMarried! When?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut to whom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo an English lawyer named Norton.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut she could not love him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am in hopes that she does.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why in hopes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If\r\nthe lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does\r\nnot love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with\r\nyour Majesty\u2019s plan.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true. And yet\u2014! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!\r\nWhat a queen she would have made!\u201d He relapsed into a moody silence,\r\nwhich was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\r\n\r\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the\r\nsteps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\r\nbrougham.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\u201d said she.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Mr. Holmes,\u201d answered my companion, looking at her with a\r\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left\r\nthis morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for\r\nthe Continent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\r\nsurprise. \u201cDo you mean that she has left England?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever to return.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the papers?\u201d asked the King hoarsely. \u201cAll is lost.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall see.\u201d He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\r\ndrawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was\r\nscattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open\r\ndrawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.\r\nHolmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,\r\nplunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The\r\nphotograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was\r\nsuperscribed to \u201cSherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.\u201d My\r\nfriend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at\r\nmidnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\r\n\r\n    \u201cMY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\u2014You really did it very well. You took\r\n    me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a\r\n    suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I\r\n    began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had\r\n    been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly\r\n    be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you\r\n    made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\r\n    suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old\r\n    clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.\r\n    Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the\r\n    freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,\r\n    ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came\r\n    down just as you departed.\r\n\r\n    \u201cWell, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was\r\n    really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\r\n    Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for\r\n    the Temple to see my husband.\r\n\r\n    \u201cWe both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so\r\n    formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you\r\n    call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in\r\n    peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do\r\n    what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly\r\n    wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a\r\n    weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might\r\n    take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to\r\n    possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\r\n\r\n\r\n    \u201cVery truly yours,\r\n\r\n    \u201cIRENE NORTON, _n\u00e9e_ ADLER.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a woman\u2014oh, what a woman!\u201d cried the King of Bohemia, when we had\r\nall three read this epistle. \u201cDid I not tell you how quick and resolute\r\nshe was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity\r\nthat she was not on my level?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very\r\ndifferent level to your Majesty,\u201d said Holmes coldly. \u201cI am sorry that\r\nI have not been able to bring your Majesty\u2019s business to a more\r\nsuccessful conclusion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, my dear sir,\u201d cried the King; \u201cnothing could be more\r\nsuccessful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as\r\nsafe as if it were in the fire.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward\r\nyou. This ring\u2014\u201d He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and\r\nheld it out upon the palm of his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,\u201d\r\nsaid Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have but to name it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis photograph!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\r\n\r\n\u201cIrene\u2019s photograph!\u201d he cried. \u201cCertainly, if you wish it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter.\r\nI have the honour to wish you a very good morning.\u201d He bowed, and,\r\nturning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched\r\nout to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\r\n\r\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of\r\nBohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a\r\nwoman\u2019s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I\r\nhave not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or\r\nwhen he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable\r\ntitle of _the_ woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\r\n\r\n\r\n I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the\r\n autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very\r\n stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an\r\n apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled\r\n me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,\u201d he\r\nsaid cordially.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was afraid that you were engaged.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I am. Very much so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I can wait in the next room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper\r\nin many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will\r\nbe of the utmost use to me in yours also.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of\r\ngreeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small\r\nfat-encircled eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cTry the settee,\u201d said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting\r\nhis fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. \u201cI\r\nknow, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and\r\noutside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have\r\nshown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to\r\nchronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish\r\nso many of my own little adventures.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\u201d I\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went\r\ninto the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that\r\nfor strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life\r\nitself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the\r\nimagination.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for\r\notherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your\r\nreason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr.\r\nJabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning,\r\nand to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular\r\nwhich I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that\r\nthe strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with\r\nthe larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where\r\nthere is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.\r\nAs far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the\r\npresent case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events\r\nis certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.\r\nPerhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence\r\nyour narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has\r\nnot heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the\r\nstory makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As\r\na rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of\r\nevents, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar\r\ncases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to\r\nadmit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some\r\nlittle pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside\r\npocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column,\r\nwith his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee,\r\nI took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my\r\ncompanion, to read the indications which might be presented by his\r\ndress or appearance.\r\n\r\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore\r\nevery mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese,\r\npompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd\u2019s check trousers,\r\na not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab\r\nwaistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of\r\nmetal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown\r\novercoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.\r\nAltogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man\r\nsave his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and\r\ndiscontent upon his features.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes\u2019 quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head\r\nwith a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. \u201cBeyond the obvious\r\nfacts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff,\r\nthat he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done\r\na considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the\r\npaper, but his eyes upon my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\nhe asked. \u201cHow did you know, for example, that I did manual labour.\r\nIt\u2019s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship\u2019s carpenter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than\r\nyour left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more\r\ndeveloped.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,\r\nespecially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use\r\nan arc-and-compass breastpin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five\r\ninches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you\r\nrest it upon the desk?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, but China?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist\r\ncould only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo\r\nmarks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That\r\ntrick of staining the fishes\u2019 scales of a delicate pink is quite\r\npeculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from\r\nyour watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. \u201cWell, I never!\u201d said he. \u201cI thought\r\nat first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was\r\nnothing in it after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI begin to think, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat I make a mistake in\r\nexplaining. \u2018_Omne ignotum pro magnifico_,\u2019 you know, and my poor\r\nlittle reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so\r\ncandid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have got it now,\u201d he answered with his thick red finger planted\r\nhalfway down the column. \u201cHere it is. This is what began it all. You\r\njust read it for yourself, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took the paper from him and read as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cTO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late\r\nEzekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another\r\nvacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of \u00a3 4 a\r\nweek for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in\r\nbody and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible.\r\nApply in person on Monday, at eleven o\u2019clock, to Duncan Ross, at the\r\noffices of the League, 7 Pope\u2019s Court, Fleet Street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth does this mean?\u201d I ejaculated after I had twice read\r\nover the extraordinary announcement.\r\n\r\nHolmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in\r\nhigh spirits. \u201cIt is a little off the beaten track, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said he.\r\n\u201cAnd now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about\r\nyourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had\r\nupon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper\r\nand the date.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is _The Morning Chronicle_ of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good. Now, Mr. Wilson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d\r\nsaid Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; \u201cI have a small pawnbroker\u2019s\r\nbusiness at Coburg Square, near the City. It\u2019s not a very large affair,\r\nand of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I\r\nused to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I\r\nwould have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half\r\nwages so as to learn the business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the name of this obliging youth?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis name is Vincent Spaulding, and he\u2019s not such a youth, either. It\u2019s\r\nhard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes;\r\nand I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I\r\nam able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I\r\nput ideas in his head?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an _employ\u00e9_ who comes\r\nunder the full market price. It is not a common experience among\r\nemployers in this age. I don\u2019t know that your assistant is not as\r\nremarkable as your advertisement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he has his faults, too,\u201d said Mr. Wilson. \u201cNever was such a fellow\r\nfor photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be\r\nimproving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit\r\ninto its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on\r\nthe whole he\u2019s a good worker. There\u2019s no vice in him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is still with you, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking\r\nand keeps the place clean\u2014that\u2019s all I have in the house, for I am a\r\nwidower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three\r\nof us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do\r\nnothing more.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he\r\ncame down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very\r\npaper in his hand, and he says:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why that?\u2019 I asks.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why,\u2019 says he, \u2018here\u2019s another vacancy on the League of the\r\nRed-headed Men. It\u2019s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets\r\nit, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men,\r\nso that the trustees are at their wits\u2019 end what to do with the money.\r\nIf my hair would only change colour, here\u2019s a nice little crib all\r\nready for me to step into.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, what is it, then?\u2019 I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very\r\nstay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to\r\ngo to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the\r\ndoor-mat. In that way I didn\u2019t know much of what was going on outside,\r\nand I was always glad of a bit of news.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?\u2019 he asked\r\nwith his eyes open.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Never.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the\r\nvacancies.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And what are they worth?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it\r\nneed not interfere very much with one\u2019s other occupations.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the\r\nbusiness has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of\r\nhundred would have been very handy.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tell me all about it,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said he, showing me the advertisement, \u2018you can see for\r\nyourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where\r\nyou should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League\r\nwas founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very\r\npeculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great\r\nsympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he\r\nhad left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with\r\ninstructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to\r\nmen whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay\r\nand very little to do.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But,\u2019 said I, \u2018there would be millions of red-headed men who would\r\napply.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Not so many as you might think,\u2019 he answered. \u2018You see it is really\r\nconfined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from\r\nLondon when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.\r\nThen, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is\r\nlight red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery\r\nred. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in;\r\nbut perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of\r\nthe way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my\r\nhair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if\r\nthere was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance\r\nas any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so\r\nmuch about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered\r\nhim to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me.\r\nHe was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and\r\nstarted off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From\r\nnorth, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his\r\nhair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet\r\nStreet was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope\u2019s Court looked like a\r\ncoster\u2019s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in\r\nthe whole country as were brought together by that single\r\nadvertisement. Every shade of colour they were\u2014straw, lemon, orange,\r\nbrick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were\r\nnot many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how\r\nmany were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding\r\nwould not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed\r\nand pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up\r\nto the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon\r\nthe stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we\r\nwedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour experience has been a most entertaining one,\u201d remarked Holmes as\r\nhis client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.\r\n\u201cPray continue your very interesting statement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a\r\ndeal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even\r\nredder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up,\r\nand then he always managed to find some fault in them which would\r\ndisqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy\r\nmatter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much\r\nmore favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door\r\nas we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,\u2019 said my assistant, \u2018and he is willing to\r\nfill a vacancy in the League.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And he is admirably suited for it,\u2019 the other answered. \u2018He has every\r\nrequirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.\u2019 He\r\ntook a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair\r\nuntil I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my\r\nhand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It would be injustice to hesitate,\u2019 said he. \u2018You will, however, I am\r\nsure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.\u2019 With that he seized\r\nmy hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.\r\n\u2018There is water in your eyes,\u2019 said he as he released me. \u2018I perceive\r\nthat all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have\r\ntwice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales\r\nof cobbler\u2019s wax which would disgust you with human nature.\u2019 He stepped\r\nover to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that\r\nthe vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,\r\nand the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was\r\nnot a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My name,\u2019 said he, \u2018is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the\r\npensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a\r\nmarried man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI answered that I had not.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis face fell immediately.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Dear me!\u2019 he said gravely, \u2018that is very serious indeed! I am sorry\r\nto hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and\r\nspread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is\r\nexceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cMy face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not\r\nto have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few\r\nminutes he said that it would be all right.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018In the case of another,\u2019 said he, \u2018the objection might be fatal, but\r\nwe must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as\r\nyours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!\u2019 said Vincent Spaulding. \u2018I\r\nshould be able to look after that for you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What would be the hours?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ten to two.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cNow a pawnbroker\u2019s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes,\r\nespecially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day;\r\nso it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.\r\nBesides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see\r\nto anything that turned up.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That would suit me very well,\u2019 said I. \u2018And the pay?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Is \u00a3 4 a week.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And the work?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Is purely nominal.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What do you call purely nominal?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the\r\nwhole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The\r\nwill is very clear upon that point. You don\u2019t comply with the\r\nconditions if you budge from the office during that time.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,\u2019 said\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No excuse will avail,\u2019 said Mr. Duncan Ross; \u2018neither sickness nor\r\nbusiness nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your\r\nbillet.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And the work?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Is to copy out the _Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica_. There is the first\r\nvolume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and\r\nblotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready\r\nto-morrow?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Certainly,\u2019 I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once\r\nmore on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to\r\ngain.\u2019 He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant,\r\nhardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low\r\nspirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair\r\nmust be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I\r\ncould not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could\r\nmake such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything\r\nso simple as copying out the _Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica_. Vincent\r\nSpaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had\r\nreasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I\r\ndetermined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of\r\nink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I\r\nstarted off for Pope\u2019s Court.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.\r\nThe table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to\r\nsee that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and\r\nthen he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all\r\nwas right with me. At two o\u2019clock he bade me good-day, complimented me\r\nupon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office\r\nafter me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager\r\ncame in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week\u2019s work. It\r\nwas the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I\r\nwas there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.\r\nDuncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a\r\ntime, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to\r\nleave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,\r\nand the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would\r\nnot risk the loss of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cEight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and\r\nArchery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with\r\ndiligence that I might get on to the B\u2019s before very long. It cost me\r\nsomething in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my\r\nwritings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo an end?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual\r\nat ten o\u2019clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square\r\nof cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here\r\nit is, and you can read for yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of\r\nnote-paper. It read in this fashion:\r\n\r\n\u201cTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful\r\nface behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely\r\novertopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar\r\nof laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot see that there is anything very funny,\u201d cried our client,\r\nflushing up to the roots of his flaming head. \u201cIf you can do nothing\r\nbetter than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he\r\nhad half risen. \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t miss your case for the world. It is\r\nmost refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying\r\nso, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you\r\ntake when you found the card upon the door?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the\r\noffices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.\r\nFinally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the\r\nground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of\r\nthe Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such\r\nbody. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the\r\nname was new to him.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said I, \u2018the gentleman at No. 4.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What, the red-headed man?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 said he, \u2018his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and\r\nwas using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises\r\nwere ready. He moved out yesterday.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where could I find him?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King\r\nEdward Street, near St. Paul\u2019s.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a\r\nmanufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of\r\neither Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did you do then?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my\r\nassistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that\r\nif I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,\r\nMr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,\r\nas I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk\r\nwho were in need of it, I came right away to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you did very wisely,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYour case is an exceedingly\r\nremarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you\r\nhave told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from\r\nit than might at first sight appear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGrave enough!\u201d said Mr. Jabez Wilson. \u201cWhy, I have lost four pound a\r\nweek.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs far as you are personally concerned,\u201d remarked Holmes, \u201cI do not\r\nsee that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On\r\nthe contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some \u00a3 30, to say\r\nnothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject\r\nwhich comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what\r\ntheir object was in playing this prank\u2014if it was a prank\u2014upon me. It\r\nwas a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty\r\npounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one\r\nor two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called\r\nyour attention to the advertisement\u2014how long had he been with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout a month then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did he come?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn answer to an advertisement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas he the only applicant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I had a dozen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you pick him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause he was handy and would come cheap.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt half wages, in fact.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,\r\nthough he\u2019s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his\r\nforehead.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. \u201cI thought as\r\nmuch,\u201d said he. \u201cHave you ever observed that his ears are pierced for\r\nearrings?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a\r\nlad.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum!\u201d said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. \u201cHe is still with\r\nyou?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd has your business been attended to in your absence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing to complain of, sir. There\u2019s never very much to do of a\r\nmorning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon\r\nthe subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I\r\nhope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Watson,\u201d said Holmes when our visitor had left us, \u201cwhat do you\r\nmake of it all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI make nothing of it,\u201d I answered frankly. \u201cIt is a most mysterious\r\nbusiness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs a rule,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthe more bizarre a thing is the less\r\nmysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes\r\nwhich are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most\r\ndifficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do, then?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo smoke,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg\r\nthat you won\u2019t speak to me for fifty minutes.\u201d He curled himself up in\r\nhis chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and\r\nthere he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out\r\nlike the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that\r\nhe had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly\r\nsprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his\r\nmind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\u201cSarasate plays at the St. James\u2019s Hall this afternoon,\u201d he remarked.\r\n\u201cWhat do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few\r\nhours?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and\r\nwe can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal\r\nof German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than\r\nItalian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come\r\nalong!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk\r\ntook us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we\r\nhad listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel\r\nplace, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out\r\ninto a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few\r\nclumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden\r\nand uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with\r\n\u201cJABEZ WILSON\u201d in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the\r\nplace where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock\r\nHolmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it\r\nall over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he\r\nwalked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still\r\nlooking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker\u2019s,\r\nand, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or\r\nthree times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly\r\nopened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to\r\nstep in.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI only wished to ask you how you would go\r\nfrom here to the Strand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThird right, fourth left,\u201d answered the assistant promptly, closing\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\u201cSmart fellow, that,\u201d observed Holmes as we walked away. \u201cHe is, in my\r\njudgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not\r\nsure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him\r\nbefore.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEvidently,\u201d said I, \u201cMr. Wilson\u2019s assistant counts for a good deal in\r\nthis mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your\r\nway merely in order that you might see him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe knees of his trousers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did you see?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I expected to see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you beat the pavement?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are\r\nspies in an enemy\u2019s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.\r\nLet us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from\r\nthe retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as\r\nthe front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main\r\narteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west.\r\nThe roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in\r\na double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with\r\nthe hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we\r\nlooked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that\r\nthey really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant\r\nsquare which we had just quitted.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see,\u201d said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along\r\nthe line, \u201cI should like just to remember the order of the houses here.\r\nIt is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is\r\nMortimer\u2019s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg\r\nbranch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and\r\nMcFarlane\u2019s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the\r\nother block. And now, Doctor, we\u2019ve done our work, so it\u2019s time we had\r\nsome play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,\r\nwhere all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no\r\nred-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very\r\ncapable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the\r\nafternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,\r\ngently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his\r\ngently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those\r\nof Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,\r\nready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his\r\nsingular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his\r\nextreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought,\r\nthe reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\r\noccasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from\r\nextreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never\r\nso truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in\r\nhis armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.\r\nThen it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,\r\nand that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of\r\nintuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would\r\nlook askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other\r\nmortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St.\r\nJames\u2019s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom\r\nhe had set himself to hunt down.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,\u201d he remarked as we emerged.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it would be as well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I have some business to do which will take some hours. This\r\nbusiness at Coburg Square is serious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy serious?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to\r\nbelieve that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday\r\nrather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt what time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTen will be early enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be at Baker Street at ten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so\r\nkindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\u201d He waved his hand,\r\nturned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\r\n\r\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always\r\noppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock\r\nHolmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had\r\nseen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not\r\nonly what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the\r\nwhole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my\r\nhouse in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story\r\nof the red-headed copier of the _Encyclop\u00e6dia_ down to the visit to\r\nSaxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from\r\nme. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?\r\nWhere were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes\r\nthat this smooth-faced pawnbroker\u2019s assistant was a formidable man\u2014a\r\nman who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it\r\nup in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way\r\nacross the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two\r\nhansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard\r\nthe sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in\r\nanimated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter\r\nJones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin,\r\nsad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable\r\nfrock-coat.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! Our party is complete,\u201d said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket\r\nand taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. \u201cWatson, I think you\r\nknow Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.\r\nMerryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night\u2019s adventure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,\u201d said Jones in his\r\nconsequential way. \u201cOur friend here is a wonderful man for starting a\r\nchase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\u201d\r\nobserved Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,\u201d said the\r\npolice agent loftily. \u201cHe has his own little methods, which are, if he\r\nwon\u2019t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,\r\nbut he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say\r\nthat once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the\r\nAgra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official\r\nforce.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,\u201d said the stranger with\r\ndeference. \u201cStill, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first\r\nSaturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my\r\nrubber.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you will find,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, \u201cthat you will play for\r\na higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play\r\nwill be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be\r\nsome \u00a3 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you\r\nwish to lay your hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He\u2019s a young man,\r\nMr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would\r\nrather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He\u2019s a\r\nremarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke,\r\nand he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as\r\nhis fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never\r\nknow where to find the man himself. He\u2019ll crack a crib in Scotland one\r\nweek, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.\r\nI\u2019ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I\u2019ve\r\nhad one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with\r\nyou that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,\r\nand quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom,\r\nWatson and I will follow in the second.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and\r\nlay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the\r\nafternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets\r\nuntil we emerged into Farrington Street.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are close there now,\u201d my friend remarked. \u201cThis fellow Merryweather\r\nis a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought\r\nit as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though\r\nan absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He\r\nis as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his\r\nclaws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\r\nourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the\r\nguidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and\r\nthrough a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small\r\ncorridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was\r\nopened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated\r\nat another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a\r\nlantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and\r\nso, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was\r\npiled all round with crates and massive boxes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not very vulnerable from above,\u201d Holmes remarked as he held up\r\nthe lantern and gazed about him.\r\n\r\n\u201cNor from below,\u201d said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the\r\nflags which lined the floor. \u201cWhy, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\u201d he\r\nremarked, looking up in surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must really ask you to be a little more quiet!\u201d said Holmes\r\nseverely. \u201cYou have already imperilled the whole success of our\r\nexpedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down\r\nupon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\r\ninjured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon\r\nthe floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine\r\nminutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to\r\nsatisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have at least an hour before us,\u201d he remarked, \u201cfor they can hardly\r\ntake any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they\r\nwill not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer\r\ntime they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor\u2014as no\r\ndoubt you have divined\u2014in the cellar of the City branch of one of the\r\nprincipal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors,\r\nand he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring\r\ncriminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar\r\nat present.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is our French gold,\u201d whispered the director. \u201cWe have had several\r\nwarnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour French gold?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\r\nborrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It\r\nhas become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money,\r\nand that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit\r\ncontains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our\r\nreserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a\r\nsingle branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the\r\nsubject.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich were very well justified,\u201d observed Holmes. \u201cAnd now it is time\r\nthat we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters\r\nwill come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the\r\nscreen over that dark lantern.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd sit in the dark?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I\r\nthought that, as we were a _partie carr\u00e9e_, you might have your rubber\r\nafter all. But I see that the enemy\u2019s preparations have gone so far\r\nthat we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must\r\nchoose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take\r\nthem at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.\r\nI shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind\r\nthose. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they\r\nfire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.\u201d\r\n\r\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\r\nwhich I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern\r\nand left us in pitch darkness\u2014such an absolute darkness as I have never\r\nbefore experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that\r\nthe light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment\u2019s notice. To\r\nme, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was\r\nsomething depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold\r\ndank air of the vault.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have but one retreat,\u201d whispered Holmes. \u201cThat is back through\r\nthe house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I\r\nasked you, Jones?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and\r\nwait.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an\r\nhour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have\r\nalmost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and\r\nstiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up\r\nto the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I\r\ncould not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could\r\ndistinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the\r\nthin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look\r\nover the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught\r\nthe glint of a light.\r\n\r\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it\r\nlengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any\r\nwarning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,\r\nalmost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area\r\nof light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,\r\nprotruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it\r\nappeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which\r\nmarked a chink between the stones.\r\n\r\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing\r\nsound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and\r\nleft a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a\r\nlantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which\r\nlooked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the\r\naperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee\r\nrested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the\r\nhole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like\r\nhimself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all clear,\u201d he whispered. \u201cHave you the chisel and the bags?\r\nGreat Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I\u2019ll swing for it!\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.\r\nThe other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth\r\nas Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a\r\nrevolver, but Holmes\u2019 hunting crop came down on the man\u2019s wrist, and\r\nthe pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use, John Clay,\u201d said Holmes blandly. \u201cYou have no chance at\r\nall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I see,\u201d the other answered with the utmost coolness. \u201cI fancy that\r\nmy pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are three men waiting for him at the door,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must\r\ncompliment you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I you,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cYour red-headed idea was very new and\r\neffective.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see your pal again presently,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe\u2019s quicker at\r\nclimbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,\u201d remarked our\r\nprisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. \u201cYou may not be\r\naware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also,\r\nwhen you address me always to say \u2018sir\u2019 and \u2018please.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Jones with a stare and a snigger. \u201cWell, would you\r\nplease, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your\r\nHighness to the police-station?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is better,\u201d said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to\r\nthe three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from\r\nthe cellar, \u201cI do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.\r\nThere is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most\r\ncomplete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery\r\nthat have ever come within my experience.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John\r\nClay,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI have been at some small expense over this\r\nmatter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am\r\namply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,\r\nand by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, Watson,\u201d he explained in the early hours of the morning as we\r\nsat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, \u201cit was perfectly\r\nobvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather\r\nfantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying\r\nof the _Encyclop\u00e6dia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker\r\nout of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of\r\nmanaging it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.\r\nThe method was no doubt suggested to Clay\u2019s ingenious mind by the\r\ncolour of his accomplice\u2019s hair. The \u00a3 4 a week was a lure which must\r\ndraw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They\r\nput in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other\r\nrogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to\r\nsecure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I\r\nheard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me\r\nthat he had some strong motive for securing the situation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how could you guess what the motive was?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere\r\nvulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man\u2019s\r\nbusiness was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which\r\ncould account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure\r\nas they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What\r\ncould it be? I thought of the assistant\u2019s fondness for photography, and\r\nhis trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end\r\nof this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious\r\nassistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most\r\ndaring criminals in London. He was doing something in the\r\ncellar\u2014something which took many hours a day for months on end. What\r\ncould it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was\r\nrunning a tunnel to some other building.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I\r\nsurprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was\r\nascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It\r\nwas not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant\r\nanswered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes\r\nupon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were\r\nwhat I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn,\r\nwrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of\r\nburrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I\r\nwalked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our\r\nfriend\u2019s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you\r\ndrove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the\r\nchairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?\u201d I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they\r\ncared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson\u2019s presence\u2014in other words, that\r\nthey had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should\r\nuse it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be\r\nremoved. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it\r\nwould give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I\r\nexpected them to come to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou reasoned it out beautifully,\u201d I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration.\r\n\u201cIt is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt saved me from ennui,\u201d he answered, yawning. \u201cAlas! I already feel\r\nit closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape\r\nfrom the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do\r\nso.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you are a benefactor of the race,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \u201cWell, perhaps, after all, it is of some\r\nlittle use,\u201d he remarked. \u201c\u2018_L\u2019homme c\u2019est rien\u2014l\u2019\u0153uvre c\u2019est tout_,\u2019\r\nas Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. A CASE OF IDENTITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the\r\nfire in his lodgings at Baker Street, \u201clife is infinitely stranger than\r\nanything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to\r\nconceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If\r\nwe could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great\r\ncity, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which\r\nare going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the\r\ncross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through\r\ngenerations, and leading to the most _outr\u00e9_ results, it would make all\r\nfiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale\r\nand unprofitable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet I am not convinced of it,\u201d I answered. \u201cThe cases which come\r\nto light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.\r\nWe have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and\r\nyet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor\r\nartistic.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a\r\nrealistic effect,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cThis is wanting in the police\r\nreport, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the\r\nmagistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the\r\nvital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so\r\nunnatural as the commonplace.\u201d\r\n\r\nI smiled and shook my head. \u201cI can quite understand your thinking so,\u201d\r\nI said. \u201cOf course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper\r\nto everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,\r\nyou are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But\r\nhere\u201d\u2014I picked up the morning paper from the ground\u2014\u201clet us put it to a\r\npractical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. \u2018A\r\nhusband\u2019s cruelty to his wife.\u2019 There is half a column of print, but I\r\nknow without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There\r\nis, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the\r\nbruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers\r\ncould invent nothing more crude.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,\u201d said\r\nHolmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \u201cThis is the\r\nDundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing\r\nup some small points in connection with it. The husband was a\r\nteetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was\r\nthat he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking\r\nout his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will\r\nallow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the\r\naverage story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge\r\nthat I have scored over you in your example.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the\r\ncentre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely\r\nways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cI forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is\r\na little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance\r\nin the case of the Irene Adler papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the ring?\u201d I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which\r\nsparkled upon his finger.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which\r\nI served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to\r\nyou, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little\r\nproblems.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd have you any on hand just now?\u201d I asked with interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.\r\nThey are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed,\r\nI have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a\r\nfield for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and\r\neffect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are\r\napt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a\r\nrule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate\r\nmatter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing\r\nwhich presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that\r\nI may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this\r\nis one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds\r\ngazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over\r\nhis shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large\r\nwoman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red\r\nfeather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess\r\nof Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she\r\npeeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her\r\nbody oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her\r\nglove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves\r\nthe bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of\r\nthe bell.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen those symptoms before,\u201d said Holmes, throwing his\r\ncigarette into the fire. \u201cOscillation upon the pavement always means an\r\n_affaire de c\u0153ur_. She would like advice, but is not sure that the\r\nmatter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may\r\ndiscriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no\r\nlonger oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we\r\nmay take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so\r\nmuch angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to\r\nresolve our doubts.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered\r\nto announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind\r\nhis small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny\r\npilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for\r\nwhich he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into\r\nan armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted\r\nfashion which was peculiar to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you not find,\u201d he said, \u201cthat with your short sight it is a little\r\ntrying to do so much typewriting?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did at first,\u201d she answered, \u201cbut now I know where the letters are\r\nwithout looking.\u201d Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his\r\nwords, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and\r\nastonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard about\r\nme, Mr. Holmes,\u201d she cried, \u201celse how could you know all that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Holmes, laughing; \u201cit is my business to know things.\r\nPerhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why\r\nshould you come to consult me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose\r\nhusband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up\r\nfor dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I\u2019m not\r\nrich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the\r\nlittle that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what\r\nhas become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\u201d asked Sherlock\r\nHolmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\r\n\r\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary\r\nSutherland. \u201cYes, I did bang out of the house,\u201d she said, \u201cfor it made\r\nme angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank\u2014that is, my\r\nfather\u2014took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go\r\nto you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that\r\nthere was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things\r\nand came right away to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour father,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cyour stepfather, surely, since the name is\r\ndifferent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,\r\nfor he is only five years and two months older than myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your mother is alive?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn\u2019t best pleased, Mr. Holmes,\r\nwhen she married again so soon after father\u2019s death, and a man who was\r\nnearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the\r\nTottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which\r\nmother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank\r\ncame he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a\r\ntraveller in wines. They got \u00a3 4700 for the goodwill and interest,\r\nwhich wasn\u2019t near as much as father could have got if he had been\r\nalive.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and\r\ninconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with\r\nthe greatest concentration of attention.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour own little income,\u201d he asked, \u201cdoes it come out of the business?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in\r\nAuckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4\u00bd per cent. Two thousand\r\nfive hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou interest me extremely,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cAnd since you draw so large\r\na sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no\r\ndoubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that\r\na single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about \u00a3 60.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand\r\nthat as long as I live at home I don\u2019t wish to be a burden to them, and\r\nso they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of\r\ncourse, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest\r\nevery quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do\r\npretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a\r\nsheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have made your position very clear to me,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis is\r\nmy friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before\r\nmyself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer\r\nAngel.\u201d\r\n\r\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland\u2019s face, and she picked nervously at\r\nthe fringe of her jacket. \u201cI met him first at the gasfitters\u2019 ball,\u201d\r\nshe said. \u201cThey used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then\r\nafterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank\r\ndid not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would\r\nget quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But\r\nthis time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to\r\nprevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all\r\nfather\u2019s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit\r\nto wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken\r\nout of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to\r\nFrance upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with\r\nMr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr.\r\nHosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat when Mr. Windibank came back from\r\nFrance he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and\r\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a\r\nwoman, for she would have her way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. Then at the gasfitters\u2019 ball you met, as I understand, a\r\ngentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we\r\nhad got home all safe, and after that we met him\u2014that is to say, Mr.\r\nHolmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back\r\nagain, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you know father didn\u2019t like anything of the sort. He wouldn\u2019t\r\nhave any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman\r\nshould be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to\r\nmother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got\r\nmine yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote\r\nand said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until\r\nhe had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every\r\nday. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for\r\nfather to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we\r\ntook. Hosmer\u2014Mr. Angel\u2014was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall\r\nStreet\u2014and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat office?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did he live, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe slept on the premises.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know his address?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014except that it was Leadenhall Street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did you address your letters, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He\r\nsaid that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all\r\nthe other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to\r\ntypewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn\u2019t have that, for he said\r\nthat when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were\r\ntypewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That\r\nwill just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little\r\nthings that he would think of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was most suggestive,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt has long been an axiom of\r\nmine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you\r\nremember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the\r\nevening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be\r\nconspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was\r\ngentle. He\u2019d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he\r\ntold me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,\r\nwhispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and\r\nplain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted\r\nglasses against the glare.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned\r\nto France?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should\r\nmarry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me\r\nswear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would\r\nalways be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear,\r\nand that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour\r\nfrom the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they\r\ntalked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but\r\nthey both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him\r\nafterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I\r\ndidn\u2019t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask\r\nhis leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn\u2019t want\r\nto do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the\r\ncompany has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the\r\nvery morning of the wedding.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt missed him, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the\r\nFriday. Was it to be in church?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour\u2019s, near King\u2019s\r\nCross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras\r\nHotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he\r\nput us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which\r\nhappened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church\r\nfirst, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step\r\nout, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and\r\nlooked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not\r\nimagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own\r\neyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard\r\nanything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,\u201d said\r\nHolmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the\r\nmorning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true;\r\nand that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I\r\nwas always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would\r\nclaim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a\r\nwedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMost certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some\r\nunforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not\r\nhave talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you have no notion as to what it could have been?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne more question. How did your mother take the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your father? Did you tell him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and\r\nthat I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could\r\nanyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving\r\nme? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got\r\nmy money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was\r\nvery independent about money and never would look at a shilling of\r\nmine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write?\r\nOh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can\u2019t sleep a wink at\r\nnight.\u201d She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to\r\nsob heavily into it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall glance into the case for you,\u201d said Holmes, rising, \u201cand I\r\nhave no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight\r\nof the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it\r\nfurther. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your\r\nmemory, as he has done from your life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t think I\u2019ll see him again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what has happened to him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate\r\ndescription of him and any letters of his which you can spare.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI advertised for him in last Saturday\u2019s _Chronicle_,\u201d said she. \u201cHere\r\nis the slip and here are four letters from him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. And your address?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Angel\u2019s address you never had, I understand. Where is your\r\nfather\u2019s place of business?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of\r\nFenchurch Street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave\r\nthe papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let\r\nthe whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your\r\nlife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true\r\nto Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something\r\nnoble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect.\r\nShe laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way,\r\nwith a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still\r\npressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze\r\ndirected upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old\r\nand oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit\r\nit, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths\r\nspinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite an interesting study, that maiden,\u201d he observed. \u201cI found her\r\nmore interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather\r\na trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in\r\nAndover in \u201977, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last\r\nyear. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which\r\nwere new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to\r\nme,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look,\r\nand so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to\r\nrealise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,\r\nor the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you\r\ngather from that woman\u2019s appearance? Describe it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a\r\nfeather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn\r\nupon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was\r\nbrown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at\r\nthe neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at\r\nthe right forefinger. Her boots I didn\u2019t observe. She had small round,\r\nhanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in\r\na vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have\r\nreally done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed\r\neverything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you\r\nhave a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my\r\nboy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always\r\nat a woman\u2019s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the\r\nknee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her\r\nsleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double\r\nline a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against\r\nthe table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand\r\ntype, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side\r\nof it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the\r\nbroadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing\r\nthe dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark\r\nupon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt surprised me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested\r\non glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was\r\nwearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one\r\nhaving a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was\r\nbuttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at\r\nthe first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady,\r\notherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots,\r\nhalf-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a\r\nhurry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what else?\u201d I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my\r\nfriend\u2019s incisive reasoning.\r\n\r\n\u201cI noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home\r\nbut after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was\r\ntorn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove\r\nand finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and\r\ndipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark\r\nwould not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though\r\nrather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you\r\nmind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?\u201d\r\n\r\nI held the little printed slip to the light. \u201cMissing,\u201d it said, \u201con\r\nthe morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About\r\nfive ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black\r\nhair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and\r\nmoustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed,\r\nwhen last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat,\r\ngold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters\r\nover elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in\r\nLeadenhall Street. Anybody bringing,\u201d &c, &c.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cAs to the letters,\u201d he continued,\r\nglancing over them, \u201cthey are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in\r\nthem to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one\r\nremarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are typewritten,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat\r\nlittle \u2018Hosmer Angel\u2019 at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no\r\nsuperscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The\r\npoint about the signature is very suggestive\u2014in fact, we may call it\r\nconclusive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears\r\nupon the case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to\r\ndeny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which\r\nshould settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to\r\nthe young lady\u2019s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could\r\nmeet us here at six o\u2019clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that\r\nwe should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can\r\ndo nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our\r\nlittle problem upon the shelf for the interim.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend\u2019s subtle powers of\r\nreasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must\r\nhave some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which\r\nhe treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to\r\nfathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of\r\nBohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to\r\nthe weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary\r\ncircumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would\r\nbe a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\r\n\r\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the\r\nconviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that\r\nhe held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity\r\nof the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\r\n\r\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at\r\nthe time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the\r\nsufferer. It was not until close upon six o\u2019clock that I found myself\r\nfree and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street,\r\nhalf afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _d\u00e9nouement_ of\r\nthe little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half\r\nasleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his\r\narmchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the\r\npungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent\r\nhis day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, have you solved it?\u201d I asked as I entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, the mystery!\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There\r\nwas never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some\r\nof the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no\r\nlaw, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss\r\nSutherland?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened\r\nhis lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a\r\ntap at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the girl\u2019s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHe\r\nhas written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty\r\nyears of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland,\r\ninsinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating\r\ngrey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny\r\ntop-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the\r\nnearest chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-evening, Mr. James Windibank,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI think that this\r\ntypewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with\r\nme for six o\u2019clock?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my\r\nown master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you\r\nabout this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash\r\nlinen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she\r\ncame, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have\r\nnoticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind\r\non a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not\r\nconnected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a\r\nfamily misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless\r\nexpense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said Holmes quietly; \u201cI have every reason to believe\r\nthat I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. \u201cI am\r\ndelighted to hear it,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a curious thing,\u201d remarked Holmes, \u201cthat a typewriter has really\r\nquite as much individuality as a man\u2019s handwriting. Unless they are\r\nquite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more\r\nworn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in\r\nthis note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some\r\nlittle slurring over of the \u2018e,\u2019 and a slight defect in the tail of the\r\n\u2018r.\u2019 There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more\r\nobvious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no\r\ndoubt it is a little worn,\u201d our visitor answered, glancing keenly at\r\nHolmes with his bright little eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.\r\nWindibank,\u201d Holmes continued. \u201cI think of writing another little\r\nmonograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to\r\ncrime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I\r\nhave here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They\r\nare all typewritten. In each case, not only are the \u2018e\u2019s\u2019 slurred and\r\nthe \u2018r\u2019s\u2019 tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my\r\nmagnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I\r\nhave alluded are there as well.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. \u201cI cannot\r\nwaste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf\r\nyou can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the\r\ndoor. \u201cI let you know, then, that I have caught him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! where?\u201d shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and\r\nglancing about him like a rat in a trap.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it won\u2019t do\u2014really it won\u2019t,\u201d said Holmes suavely. \u201cThere is no\r\npossible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent,\r\nand it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible\r\nfor me to solve so simple a question. That\u2019s right! Sit down and let us\r\ntalk it over.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter\r\nof moisture on his brow. \u201cIt\u2014it\u2019s not actionable,\u201d he stammered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,\r\nWindibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty\r\nway as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of\r\nevents, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his\r\nbreast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on\r\nthe corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his\r\npockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,\u201d\r\nsaid he, \u201cand he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long\r\nas she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their\r\nposition, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It\r\nwas worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable\r\ndisposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it\r\nwas evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little\r\nincome, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her\r\nmarriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what\r\ndoes her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of\r\nkeeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of\r\nher own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She\r\nbecame restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her\r\npositive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever\r\nstepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head\r\nthan to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he\r\ndisguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked\r\nthe face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear\r\nvoice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the\r\ngirl\u2019s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other\r\nlovers by making love himself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was only a joke at first,\u201d groaned our visitor. \u201cWe never thought\r\nthat she would have been so carried away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very\r\ndecidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her\r\nstepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an\r\ninstant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman\u2019s\r\nattentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed\r\nadmiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was\r\nobvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a\r\nreal effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an\r\nengagement, which would finally secure the girl\u2019s affections from\r\nturning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up\r\nforever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The\r\nthing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a\r\ndramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the\r\nyoung lady\u2019s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor\r\nfor some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a\r\nTestament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something\r\nhappening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished\r\nMiss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to\r\nhis fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen\r\nto another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as\r\nhe could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick\r\nof stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I\r\nthink that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had\r\nbeen talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his\r\npale face.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said he, \u201cbut if you are so\r\nvery sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are\r\nbreaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from\r\nthe first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself\r\nopen to an action for assault and illegal constraint.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe law cannot, as you say, touch you,\u201d said Holmes, unlocking and\r\nthrowing open the door, \u201cyet there never was a man who deserved\r\npunishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought\r\nto lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!\u201d he continued, flushing\r\nup at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man\u2019s face, \u201cit is not\r\npart of my duties to my client, but here\u2019s a hunting crop handy, and I\r\nthink I shall just treat myself to\u2014\u201d He took two swift steps to the\r\nwhip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps\r\nupon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we\r\ncould see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cold-blooded scoundrel!\u201d said Holmes, laughing, as he threw\r\nhimself down into his chair once more. \u201cThat fellow will rise from\r\ncrime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.\r\nThe case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,\u201d I\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer\r\nAngel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was\r\nequally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as\r\nfar as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men\r\nwere never together, but that the one always appeared when the other\r\nwas away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious\r\nvoice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My\r\nsuspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his\r\nsignature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so\r\nfamiliar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of\r\nit. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones,\r\nall pointed in the same direction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did you verify them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHaving once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew\r\nthe firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed\r\ndescription. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result\r\nof a disguise\u2014the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to\r\nthe firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered\r\nto the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed\r\nthe peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at\r\nhis business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected,\r\nhis reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but\r\ncharacteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from\r\nWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description\r\ntallied in every respect with that of their employ\u00e9, James Windibank.\r\n_Voil\u00e0 tout_!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Miss Sutherland?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old\r\nPersian saying, \u2018There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and\r\ndanger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.\u2019 There is as\r\nmuch sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid\r\nbrought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the\r\nwest of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be\r\nglad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave\r\nPaddington by the 11:15.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you say, dear?\u201d said my wife, looking across at me. \u201cWill you\r\ngo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at\r\npresent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a\r\nlittle pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you\r\nare always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes\u2019 cases.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one\r\nof them,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I\r\nhave only half an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect\r\nof making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and\r\nsimple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my\r\nvalise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing\r\nup and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and\r\ntaller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is really very good of you to come, Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cIt makes a\r\nconsiderable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can\r\nthoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed.\r\nIf you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers\r\nwhich Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read,\r\nwith intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past\r\nReading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and\r\ntossed them up onto the rack.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you heard anything of the case?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been\r\nlooking through all the recent papers in order to master the\r\nparticulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple\r\ncases which are so extremely difficult.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat sounds a little paradoxical.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue.\r\nThe more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it\r\nis to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a\r\nvery serious case against the son of the murdered man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a murder, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted\r\nuntil I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will\r\nexplain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to\r\nunderstand it, in a very few words.\r\n\r\n\u201cBoscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\r\nHerefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John\r\nTurner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to\r\nthe old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was\r\nlet to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had\r\nknown each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that\r\nwhen they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as\r\npossible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his\r\ntenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as\r\nthey were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen,\r\nand Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them\r\nhad wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the\r\nneighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though\r\nboth the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the\r\nrace-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants\u2014a man\r\nand a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the\r\nleast. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the\r\nfamilies. Now for the facts.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at\r\nHatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe\r\nPool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream\r\nwhich runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his\r\nserving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he\r\nmust hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three.\r\nFrom that appointment he never came back alive.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,\r\nand two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old\r\nwoman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder,\r\na game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose\r\nthat Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a\r\nfew minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr.\r\nJames McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the\r\nbest of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and\r\nthe son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he\r\nheard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the\r\ngame-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded\r\nround, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl\r\nof fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of\r\nthe Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.\r\nShe states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood\r\nand close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared\r\nto be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using\r\nvery strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his\r\nhand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their\r\nviolence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home\r\nthat she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and\r\nthat she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said\r\nthe words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say\r\nthat he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help\r\nof the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his\r\nhat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with\r\nfresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out\r\nupon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated\r\nblows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might\r\nvery well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son\u2019s gun, which\r\nwas found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under\r\nthese circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict\r\nof \u2018wilful murder\u2019 having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he\r\nwas on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have\r\nreferred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the\r\ncase as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could hardly imagine a more damning case,\u201d I remarked. \u201cIf ever\r\ncircumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCircumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,\u201d answered Holmes\r\nthoughtfully. \u201cIt may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if\r\nyou shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in\r\nan equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It\r\nmust be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave\r\nagainst the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the\r\nculprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and\r\namong them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who\r\nbelieve in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may\r\nrecollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case\r\nin his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case\r\nto me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying\r\nwestward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their\r\nbreakfasts at home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid,\u201d said I, \u201cthat the facts are so obvious that you will\r\nfind little credit to be gained out of this case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,\u201d he answered,\r\nlaughing. \u201cBesides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts\r\nwhich may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me\r\ntoo well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either\r\nconfirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of\r\nemploying, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand,\r\nI very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the\r\nright-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have\r\nnoted even so self-evident a thing as that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow on earth\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which\r\ncharacterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you\r\nshave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete\r\nas we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively\r\nslovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear\r\nthat that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine\r\na man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being\r\nsatisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of\r\nobservation and inference. Therein lies my _m\u00e9tier_, and it is just\r\npossible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies\r\nbefore us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in\r\nthe inquest, and which are worth considering.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the\r\nreturn to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing\r\nhim that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to\r\nhear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of\r\nhis had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might\r\nhave remained in the minds of the coroner\u2019s jury.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a confession,\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cComing on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least\r\na most suspicious remark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cit is the brightest rift which I can\r\nat present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could\r\nnot be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances\r\nwere very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own\r\narrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as\r\nhighly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural\r\nunder the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to\r\na scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as\r\neither an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint\r\nand firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not\r\nunnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his\r\nfather, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far\r\nforgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,\r\naccording to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise\r\nhis hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which\r\nare displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy\r\nmind rather than of a guilty one.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head. \u201cMany men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,\u201d\r\nI remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the young man\u2019s own account of the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though\r\nthere are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find\r\nit here, and may read it for yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper,\r\nand having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which\r\nthe unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had\r\noccurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read\r\nit very carefully. It ran in this way:\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and\r\ngave evidence as follows: \u2018I had been away from home for three days at\r\nBristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday,\r\nthe 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and\r\nI was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John\r\nCobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap\r\nin the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk\r\nrapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he\r\nwas going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the\r\nBoscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which\r\nis upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the\r\ngame-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in\r\nthinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in\r\nfront of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of\r\n\u201cCooee!\u201d which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then\r\nhurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be\r\nmuch surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was\r\ndoing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost\r\nto blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that\r\nhis passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards\r\nHatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I\r\nheard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I\r\nfound my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly\r\ninjured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost\r\ninstantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made\r\nmy way to Mr. Turner\u2019s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to\r\nask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I\r\nhave no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man,\r\nbeing somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far\r\nas I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion\r\nto a rat.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: What did you understand by that?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was\r\ndelirious.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had\r\nthis final quarrel?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: I should prefer not to answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you\r\nthat it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to\r\nyou that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably\r\nin any future proceedings which may arise.\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: I must still refuse.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: I understand that the cry of \u2018Cooee\u2019 was a common signal\r\nbetween you and your father?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: It was.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you,\r\nand before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\r\n\r\n\u201cA Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you\r\nreturned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: Nothing definite.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: What do you mean?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open,\r\nthat I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague\r\nimpression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the\r\nleft of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of\r\nsome sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked\r\nround for it, but it was gone.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, it was gone.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You cannot say what it was?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I had a feeling something was there.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018How far from the body?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018A dozen yards or so.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And how far from the edge of the wood?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018About the same.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of\r\nit?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, but with my back towards it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThis concluded the examination of the witness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said I as I glanced down the column, \u201cthat the coroner in his\r\nconcluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls\r\nattention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having\r\nsignalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details\r\nof his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his\r\nfather\u2019s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against\r\nthe son.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the\r\ncushioned seat. \u201cBoth you and the coroner have been at some pains,\u201d\r\nsaid he, \u201cto single out the very strongest points in the young man\u2019s\r\nfavour. Don\u2019t you see that you alternately give him credit for having\r\ntoo much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent\r\na cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too\r\nmuch, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so\r\n_outr\u00e9_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the\r\nvanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of\r\nview that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither\r\nthat hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and\r\nnot another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of\r\naction. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty\r\nminutes.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was nearly four o\u2019clock when we at last, after passing through the\r\nbeautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found\r\nourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean,\r\nferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the\r\nplatform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings\r\nwhich he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no\r\ndifficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove\r\nto the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have ordered a carriage,\u201d said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea.\r\n\u201cI knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until\r\nyou had been on the scene of the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was very nice and complimentary of you,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cIt is\r\nentirely a question of barometric pressure.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade looked startled. \u201cI do not quite follow,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the\r\nsky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the\r\nsofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do\r\nnot think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade laughed indulgently. \u201cYou have, no doubt, already formed your\r\nconclusions from the newspapers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe case is as plain as a\r\npikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still,\r\nof course, one can\u2019t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.\r\nShe has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly\r\ntold her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not\r\nalready done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most\r\nlovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes\r\nshining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of\r\nher natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\u201d she cried, glancing from one to the other of\r\nus, and finally, with a woman\u2019s quick intuition, fastening upon my\r\ncompanion, \u201cI am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell\r\nyou so. I know that James didn\u2019t do it. I know it, and I want you to\r\nstart upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon\r\nthat point. We have known each other since we were little children, and\r\nI know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to\r\nhurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cYou may\r\nrely upon my doing all that I can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do\r\nyou not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he\r\nis innocent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that it is very probable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, now!\u201d she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly\r\nat Lestrade. \u201cYou hear! He gives me hopes.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI am afraid that my colleague has\r\nbeen a little quick in forming his conclusions,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And\r\nabout his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he\r\nwould not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many\r\ndisagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should\r\nbe a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as\r\nbrother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little\r\nof life yet, and\u2014and\u2014well, he naturally did not wish to do anything\r\nlike that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of\r\nthem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your father?\u201d asked Holmes. \u201cWas he in favour of such a union?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of\r\nit.\u201d A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one\r\nof his keen, questioning glances at her.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you for this information,\u201d said he. \u201cMay I see your father if I\r\ncall to-morrow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid the doctor won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe doctor?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years\r\nback, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed,\r\nand Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is\r\nshattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the\r\nold days in Victoria.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! In Victoria! That is important.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, at the mines.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made\r\nhis money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, certainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go\r\nto the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that\r\nI know him to be innocent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will, Miss Turner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I\r\nleave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\u201d She hurried\r\nfrom the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the\r\nwheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am ashamed of you, Holmes,\u201d said Lestrade with dignity after a few\r\nminutes\u2019 silence. \u201cWhy should you raise up hopes which you are bound to\r\ndisappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\u201cHave you an order to see him in prison?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but only for you and me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still\r\ntime to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAmple.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but\r\nI shall only be away a couple of hours.\u201d\r\n\r\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the\r\nstreets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay\r\nupon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel.\r\nThe puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the\r\ndeep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention\r\nwander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung\r\nit across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of\r\nthe events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man\u2019s story\r\nwere absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely\r\nunforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the\r\ntime when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by\r\nhis screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and\r\ndeadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal\r\nsomething to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the\r\nweekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest.\r\nIn the surgeon\u2019s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of\r\nthe left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been\r\nshattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon\r\nmy own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind.\r\nThat was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen\r\nquarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go\r\nfor very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the\r\nblow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes\u2019 attention to\r\nit. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could\r\nthat mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow\r\ndoes not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an\r\nattempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I\r\ncudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the\r\nincident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true\r\nthe murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his\r\novercoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and\r\nto carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back\r\nturned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and\r\nimprobabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade\u2019s\r\nopinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes\u2019 insight that I\r\ncould not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen\r\nhis conviction of young McCarthy\u2019s innocence.\r\n\r\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for\r\nLestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe glass still keeps very high,\u201d he remarked as he sat down. \u201cIt is\r\nof importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the\r\nground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest\r\nfor such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by\r\na long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did you learn from him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCould he throw no light?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had\r\ndone it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is\r\nas puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth,\r\nthough comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot admire his taste,\u201d I remarked, \u201cif it is indeed a fact that\r\nhe was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss\r\nTurner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,\r\ninsanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a\r\nlad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at\r\na boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of\r\na barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a\r\nword of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him\r\nto be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do,\r\nbut what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of\r\nthis sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his\r\nfather, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss\r\nTurner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and\r\nhis father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown\r\nhim over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife\r\nthat he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did\r\nnot know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has\r\ncome out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers\r\nthat he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him\r\nover utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband\r\nalready in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between\r\nthem. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all\r\nthat he has suffered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if he is innocent, who has done it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.\r\nOne is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the\r\npool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was\r\naway, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the\r\nmurdered man was heard to cry \u2018Cooee!\u2019 before he knew that his son had\r\nreturned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And\r\nnow let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall\r\nleave all minor matters until to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright\r\nand cloudless. At nine o\u2019clock Lestrade called for us with the\r\ncarriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is serious news this morning,\u201d Lestrade observed. \u201cIt is said\r\nthat Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn elderly man, I presume?\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life\r\nabroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business\r\nhas had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy\u2019s,\r\nand, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he\r\ngave him Hatherley Farm rent free.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! That is interesting,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about\r\nhere speaks of his kindness to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this\r\nMcCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been\r\nunder such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son\r\nto Turner\u2019s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and\r\nthat in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a\r\nproposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we\r\nknow that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us\r\nas much. Do you not deduce something from that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have got to the deductions and the inferences,\u201d said Lestrade,\r\nwinking at me. \u201cI find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without\r\nflying away after theories and fancies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d said Holmes demurely; \u201cyou do find it very hard to\r\ntackle the facts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to\r\nget hold of,\u201d replied Lestrade with some warmth.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that is\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all\r\ntheories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\u201d said Holmes, laughing.\r\n\u201cBut I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the\r\nleft.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that is it.\u201d It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building,\r\ntwo-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon\r\nthe grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,\r\ngave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay\r\nheavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes\u2019\r\nrequest, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his\r\ndeath, and also a pair of the son\u2019s, though not the pair which he had\r\nthen had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight\r\ndifferent points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from\r\nwhich we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as\r\nthis. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker\r\nStreet would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and\r\ndarkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his\r\neyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was\r\nbent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins\r\nstood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed\r\nto dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so\r\nabsolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or\r\nremark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a\r\nquick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way\r\nalong the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the\r\nwoods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that\r\ndistrict, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and\r\namid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes\r\nwould hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little\r\ndetour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective\r\nindifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the\r\ninterest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions\r\nwas directed towards a definite end.\r\n\r\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some\r\nfifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley\r\nFarm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods\r\nwhich lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting\r\npinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner\u2019s dwelling. On\r\nthe Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was\r\na narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of\r\nthe trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the\r\nexact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was\r\nthe ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by\r\nthe fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager\r\nface and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the\r\ntrampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and\r\nthen turned upon my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you go into the pool for?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or\r\nother trace. But how on earth\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward\r\ntwist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it\r\nvanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I\r\nbeen here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over\r\nit. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have\r\ncovered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are\r\nthree separate tracks of the same feet.\u201d He drew out a lens and lay\r\ndown upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time\r\nrather to himself than to us. \u201cThese are young McCarthy\u2019s feet. Twice\r\nhe was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply\r\nmarked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran\r\nwhen he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father\u2019s feet\r\nas he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the\r\ngun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here?\r\nTiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,\r\nthey come again\u2014of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they\r\ncome from?\u201d He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the\r\ntrack until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the\r\nshadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes\r\ntraced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon\r\nhis face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained\r\nthere, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what\r\nseemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens\r\nnot only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could\r\nreach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he\r\ncarefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the\r\nwood until he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has been a case of considerable interest,\u201d he remarked, returning\r\nto his natural manner. \u201cI fancy that this grey house on the right must\r\nbe the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and\r\nperhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our\r\nluncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into\r\nRoss, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up\r\nin the wood.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis may interest you, Lestrade,\u201d he remarked, holding it out. \u201cThe\r\nmurder was done with it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see no marks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are none.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days.\r\nThere was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds\r\nwith the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the murderer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears\r\nthick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses\r\na cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are\r\nseveral other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our\r\nsearch.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade laughed. \u201cI am afraid that I am still a sceptic,\u201d he said.\r\n\u201cTheories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed\r\nBritish jury.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Nous verrons_,\u201d answered Holmes calmly. \u201cYou work your own method,\r\nand I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall\r\nprobably return to London by the evening train.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd leave your case unfinished?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, finished.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the mystery?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is solved.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho was the criminal, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe gentleman I describe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut who is he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a\r\npopulous neighbourhood.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI am a practical man,\u201d he said, \u201cand\r\nI really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a\r\nleft-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the\r\nlaughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Holmes quietly. \u201cI have given you the chance. Here\r\nare your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we\r\nfound lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought\r\nwith a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a\r\nperplexing position.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, Watson,\u201d he said when the cloth was cleared \u201cjust sit down\r\nin this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don\u2019t know quite\r\nwhat to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me\r\nexpound.\u201d\r\n\r\n \u201cPray do so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, now, in considering this case there are two points about young\r\nMcCarthy\u2019s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they\r\nimpressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that\r\nhis father should, according to his account, cry \u2018Cooee!\u2019 before seeing\r\nhim. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled\r\nseveral words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son\u2019s\r\near. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will\r\nbegin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat of this \u2018Cooee!\u2019 then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as\r\nfar as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within\r\nearshot. The \u2018Cooee!\u2019 was meant to attract the attention of whoever it\r\nwas that he had the appointment with. But \u2018Cooee\u2019 is a distinctly\r\nAustralian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a\r\nstrong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him\r\nat Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat of the rat, then?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it\r\nout on the table. \u201cThis is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\u201d he said.\r\n\u201cI wired to Bristol for it last night.\u201d He put his hand over part of\r\nthe map. \u201cWhat do you read?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cARAT,\u201d I read.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d He raised his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cBALLARAT.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only\r\ncaught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his\r\nmurderer. So and so, of Ballarat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is wonderful!\u201d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down\r\nconsiderably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which,\r\ngranting the son\u2019s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have\r\ncome now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an\r\nAustralian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be\r\napproached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly\r\nwander.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I\r\ngained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as\r\nto the personality of the criminal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how did you gain them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his\r\nstride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, they were peculiar boots.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut his lameness?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his\r\nleft. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped\u2014he was lame.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut his left-handedness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by\r\nthe surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately\r\nbehind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it\r\nwere by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the\r\ninterview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found\r\nthe ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables\r\nme to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some\r\nattention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140\r\ndifferent varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found\r\nthe ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss\r\nwhere he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which\r\nare rolled in Rotterdam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the cigar-holder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used\r\na holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not\r\na clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I said, \u201cyou have drawn a net round this man from which he\r\ncannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if\r\nyou had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in\r\nwhich all this points. The culprit is\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. John Turner,\u201d cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our\r\nsitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow,\r\nlimping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude,\r\nand yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs\r\nshowed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of\r\ncharacter. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping\r\neyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his\r\nappearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the\r\ncorners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear\r\nto me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\u201cPray sit down on the sofa,\u201d said Holmes gently. \u201cYou had my note?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see\r\nme here to avoid scandal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why did you wish to see me?\u201d He looked across at my companion with\r\ndespair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. \u201cIt is\r\nso. I know all about McCarthy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. \u201cGod help me!\u201d he cried. \u201cBut I\r\nwould not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that\r\nI would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad to hear you say so,\u201d said Holmes gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would\r\nbreak her heart\u2014it will break her heart when she hears that I am\r\narrested.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may not come to that,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who\r\nrequired my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young\r\nMcCarthy must be got off, however.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am a dying man,\u201d said old Turner. \u201cI have had diabetes for years. My\r\ndoctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would\r\nrather die under my own roof than in a gaol.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a\r\nbundle of paper before him. \u201cJust tell us the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cI shall\r\njot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it.\r\nThen I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save\r\nyoung McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is\r\nabsolutely needed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s as well,\u201d said the old man; \u201cit\u2019s a question whether I shall live\r\nto the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare\r\nAlice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has\r\nbeen a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I\r\ntell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.\r\nHis grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my\r\nlife. I\u2019ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was in the early \u201960\u2019s at the diggings. I was a young chap then,\r\nhot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got\r\namong bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to\r\nthe bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway\r\nrobber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it,\r\nsticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the\r\nroad to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under,\r\nand our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay\r\nin wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us,\r\nso it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the\r\nfirst volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the\r\nswag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this\r\nvery man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I\r\nspared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as\r\nthough to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became\r\nwealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected.\r\nThere I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a\r\nquiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be\r\nin the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to\r\nmake up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and\r\nthough my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when\r\nshe was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path\r\nas nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and\r\ndid my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy\r\nlaid his grip upon me.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent\r\nStreet with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Here we are, Jack,\u2019 says he, touching me on the arm; \u2018we\u2019ll be as\r\ngood as a family to you. There\u2019s two of us, me and my son, and you can\r\nhave the keeping of us. If you don\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s a fine, law-abiding country\r\nis England, and there\u2019s always a policeman within hail.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them\r\noff, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since.\r\nThere was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I\r\nwould, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse\r\nas Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my\r\npast than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever\r\nit was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last\r\nhe asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known\r\nto be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad\r\nshould step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not\r\nhave his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to\r\nthe lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm.\r\nMcCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at\r\nthe pool midway between our houses to talk it over.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a\r\ncigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I\r\nlistened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come\r\nuppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little\r\nregard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the\r\nstreets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear\r\nshould be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the\r\nbond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind\r\nand fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my\r\nmemory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that\r\nfoul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I\r\nhave sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that\r\nmy girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more\r\nthan I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if\r\nhe had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son;\r\nbut I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back\r\nto fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true\r\nstory, gentlemen, of all that occurred.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is not for me to judge you,\u201d said Holmes as the old man\r\nsigned the statement which had been drawn out. \u201cI pray that we may\r\nnever be exposed to such a temptation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will\r\nsoon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I\r\nwill keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be\r\nforced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and\r\nyour secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFarewell, then,\u201d said the old man solemnly. \u201cYour own deathbeds, when\r\nthey come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you\r\nhave given to mine.\u201d Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he\r\nstumbled slowly from the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod help us!\u201d said Holmes after a long silence. \u201cWhy does fate play\r\nsuch tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as\r\nthis that I do not think of Baxter\u2019s words, and say, \u2018There, but for\r\nthe grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number\r\nof objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the\r\ndefending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our\r\ninterview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son\r\nand daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the\r\nblack cloud which rests upon their past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases\r\nbetween the years \u201982 and \u201990, I am faced by so many which present\r\nstrange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know\r\nwhich to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained\r\npublicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for\r\nthose peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree,\r\nand which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too,\r\nhave baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives,\r\nbeginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially\r\ncleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture\r\nand surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to\r\nhim. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in\r\nits details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give\r\nsome account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in\r\nconnection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,\r\nentirely cleared up.\r\n\r\nThe year \u201987 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or\r\nless interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under\r\nthis one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the\r\nParadol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious\r\nclub in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts\r\nconnected with the loss of the British barque _Sophy Anderson_, of the\r\nsingular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and\r\nfinally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be\r\nremembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man\u2019s\r\nwatch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that\r\ntherefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time\u2014a deduction\r\nwhich was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these\r\nI may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such\r\nsingular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have\r\nnow taken up my pen to describe.\r\n\r\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had\r\nset in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the\r\nrain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of\r\ngreat, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the\r\ninstant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those\r\ngreat elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his\r\ncivilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the\r\nstorm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a\r\nchild in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the\r\nfireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was\r\ndeep in one of Clark Russell\u2019s fine sea-stories until the howl of the\r\ngale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the\r\nrain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was\r\non a visit to her mother\u2019s, and for a few days I was a dweller once\r\nmore in my old quarters at Baker Street.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said I, glancing up at my companion, \u201cthat was surely the bell.\r\nWho could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcept yourself I have none,\u201d he answered. \u201cI do not encourage\r\nvisitors.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA client, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on\r\nsuch a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to\r\nbe some crony of the landlady\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a\r\nstep in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his\r\nlong arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant\r\nchair upon which a newcomer must sit.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d said he.\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside,\r\nwell-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy\r\nin his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and\r\nhis long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he\r\nhad come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I\r\ncould see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a\r\nman who is weighed down with some great anxiety.\r\n\r\n\u201cI owe you an apology,\u201d he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his\r\neyes. \u201cI trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some\r\ntraces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive me your coat and umbrella,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThey may rest here on\r\nthe hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the\r\nsouth-west, I see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, from Horsham.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite\r\ndistinctive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have come for advice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is easily got.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd help.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is not always so easy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how\r\nyou saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe said that you could solve anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe said too much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat you are never beaten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been beaten four times\u2014three times by men, and once by a\r\nwoman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what is that compared with the number of your successes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true that I have been generally successful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you may be so with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with\r\nsome details as to your case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is no ordinary one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have\r\never listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events\r\nthan those which have happened in my own family.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou fill me with interest,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cPray give us the essential\r\nfacts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to\r\nthose details which seem to me to be most important.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards\r\nthe blaze.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name,\u201d said he, \u201cis John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far\r\nas I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a\r\nhereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must\r\ngo back to the commencement of the affair.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must know that my grandfather had two sons\u2014my uncle Elias and my\r\nfather Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he\r\nenlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee\r\nof the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such\r\nsuccess that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome\r\ncompetence.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became\r\na planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At\r\nthe time of the war he fought in Jackson\u2019s army, and afterwards under\r\nHood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my\r\nuncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four\r\nyears. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small\r\nestate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune\r\nin the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the\r\nnegroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the\r\nfranchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered,\r\nvery foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring\r\ndisposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if\r\never he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields\r\nround his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very\r\noften for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great\r\ndeal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and\r\ndid not want any friends, not even his own brother.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time\r\nwhen he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be\r\nin the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He\r\nbegged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in\r\nhis way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and\r\ndraughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the\r\nservants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was\r\nsixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could\r\ngo where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him\r\nin his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a\r\nsingle room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably\r\nlocked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to\r\nenter. With a boy\u2019s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I\r\nwas never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and\r\nbundles as would be expected in such a room.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne day\u2014it was in March, 1883\u2014a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon\r\nthe table in front of the colonel\u2019s plate. It was not a common thing\r\nfor him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money,\r\nand he had no friends of any sort. \u2018From India!\u2019 said he as he took it\r\nup, \u2018Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?\u2019 Opening it hurriedly, out\r\nthere jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon\r\nhis plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my\r\nlips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were\r\nprotruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope\r\nwhich he still held in his trembling hand, \u2018K. K. K.!\u2019 he shrieked, and\r\nthen, \u2018My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What is it, uncle?\u2019 I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Death,\u2019 said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room,\r\nleaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw\r\nscrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter\r\nK three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried\r\npips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the\r\nbreakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with\r\nan old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand,\r\nand a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018They may do what they like, but I\u2019ll checkmate them still,\u2019 said he\r\nwith an oath. \u2018Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day,\r\nand send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step\r\nup to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there\r\nwas a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass\r\nbox stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed,\r\nwith a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had\r\nread in the morning upon the envelope.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I wish you, John,\u2019 said my uncle, \u2018to witness my will. I leave my\r\nestate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my\r\nbrother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you\r\ncan enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my\r\nadvice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to\r\ngive you such a two-edged thing, but I can\u2019t say what turn things are\r\ngoing to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.\r\nThe singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression\r\nupon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind\r\nwithout being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off\r\nthe vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation\r\ngrew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the\r\nusual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however.\r\nHe drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of\r\nsociety. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door\r\nlocked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of\r\ndrunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the\r\ngarden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of\r\nno man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by\r\nman or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush\r\ntumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man\r\nwho can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the\r\nroots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold\r\nday, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse\r\nyour patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken\r\nsallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to\r\nsearch for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay\r\nat the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the\r\nwater was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his\r\nknown eccentricity, brought in a verdict of \u2018suicide.\u2019 But I, who knew\r\nhow he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade\r\nmyself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,\r\nhowever, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of\r\nsome \u00a3 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d Holmes interposed, \u201cyour statement is, I foresee, one of\r\nthe most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date\r\nof the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his\r\nsupposed suicide.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,\r\nupon the night of May 2nd.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. Pray proceed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made\r\na careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We\r\nfound the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On\r\nthe inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.\r\nK. repeated upon it, and \u2018Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register\u2019\r\nwritten beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers\r\nwhich had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was\r\nnothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered\r\npapers and note-books bearing upon my uncle\u2019s life in America. Some of\r\nthem were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and\r\nhad borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during\r\nthe reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned\r\nwith politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the\r\ncarpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it was the beginning of \u201984 when my father came to live at\r\nHorsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of\r\n\u201985. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a\r\nsharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There\r\nhe was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried\r\norange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always\r\nlaughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but\r\nhe looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, what on earth does this mean, John?\u2019 he stammered.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy heart had turned to lead. \u2018It is K. K. K.,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe looked inside the envelope. \u2018So it is,\u2019 he cried. \u2018Here are the\r\nvery letters. But what is this written above them?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Put the papers on the sundial,\u2019 I read, peeping over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What papers? What sundial?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The sundial in the garden. There is no other,\u2019 said I; \u2018but the\r\npapers must be those that are destroyed.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Pooh!\u2019 said he, gripping hard at his courage. \u2018We are in a civilised\r\nland here, and we can\u2019t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the\r\nthing come from?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018From Dundee,\u2019 I answered, glancing at the postmark.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Some preposterous practical joke,\u2019 said he. \u2018What have I to do with\r\nsundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should certainly speak to the police,\u2019 I said.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then let me do so?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I forbid you. I won\u2019t have a fuss made about such nonsense.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I\r\nwent about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from\r\nhome to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command\r\nof one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go,\r\nfor it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away\r\nfrom home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his\r\nabsence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at\r\nonce. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound\r\nin the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull.\r\nI hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his\r\nconsciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in\r\nthe twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit\r\nunfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of \u2018death\r\nfrom accidental causes.\u2019 Carefully as I examined every fact connected\r\nwith his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the\r\nidea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no\r\nrobbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And\r\nyet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I\r\nwas well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I\r\ndid not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our\r\ntroubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle\u2019s\r\nlife, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was in January, \u201985, that my poor father met his end, and two years\r\nand eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived\r\nhappily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed\r\naway from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I\r\nhad begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow\r\nfell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning\r\nto the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the envelope,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe postmark is London\u2014eastern\r\ndivision. Within are the very words which were upon my father\u2019s last\r\nmessage: \u2018K. K. K.\u2019; and then \u2018Put the papers on the sundial.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo tell the truth\u201d\u2014he sank his face into his thin, white hands\u2014\u201cI have\r\nfelt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the\r\nsnake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some\r\nresistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can\r\nguard against.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTut! tut!\u201d cried Sherlock Holmes. \u201cYou must act, man, or you are lost.\r\nNothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen the police.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the\r\ninspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical\r\njokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as\r\nthe jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. \u201cIncredible imbecility!\u201d he\r\ncried.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the\r\nhouse with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas he come with you to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. His orders were to stay in the house.\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you come to me?\u201d he said, \u201cand, above all, why did you not\r\ncome at once?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast\r\nabout my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted\r\nbefore this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which\r\nyou have placed before us\u2014no suggestive detail which might help us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is one thing,\u201d said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat\r\npocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he\r\nlaid it out upon the table. \u201cI have some remembrance,\u201d said he, \u201cthat\r\non the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small,\r\nunburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular\r\ncolour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am\r\ninclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps,\r\nfluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped\r\ndestruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us\r\nmuch. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The\r\nwriting is undoubtedly my uncle\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which\r\nshowed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It\r\nwas headed, \u201cMarch, 1869,\u201d and beneath were the following enigmatical\r\nnotices:\r\n\r\n\u201c4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\r\n\r\n\u201c7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St.\r\nAugustine.\r\n\r\n\u201c9th. McCauley cleared.\r\n\r\n\u201c10th. John Swain cleared.\r\n\r\n\u201c12th. Visited Paramore. All well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you!\u201d said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our\r\nvisitor. \u201cAnd now you must on no account lose another instant. We\r\ncannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get\r\nhome instantly and act.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put\r\nthis piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which\r\nyou have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the\r\nother papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one\r\nwhich remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry\r\nconviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box\r\nout upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEntirely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think\r\nthat we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to\r\nweave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to\r\nremove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear\r\nup the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank you,\u201d said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat.\r\n\u201cYou have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you\r\nadvise.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the\r\nmeanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are\r\nthreatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy train from Waterloo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you\r\nmay be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am armed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall see you at Horsham, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to\r\nthe box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.\u201d\r\nHe shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still\r\nscreamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This\r\nstrange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad\r\nelements\u2014blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale\u2014and now to\r\nhave been reabsorbed by them once more.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk\r\nforward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit\r\nhis pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings\r\nas they chased each other up to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think, Watson,\u201d he remarked at last, \u201cthat of all our cases we have\r\nhad none more fantastic than this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSave, perhaps, the Sign of Four.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me\r\nto be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut have you,\u201d I asked, \u201cformed any definite conception as to what\r\nthese perils are?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere can be no question as to their nature,\u201d he answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this\r\nunhappy family?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of\r\nhis chair, with his finger-tips together. \u201cThe ideal reasoner,\u201d he\r\nremarked, \u201cwould, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its\r\nbearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up\r\nto it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier\r\ncould correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a\r\nsingle bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in\r\na series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other\r\nones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which\r\nthe reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study\r\nwhich have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of\r\ntheir senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is\r\nnecessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts\r\nwhich have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you\r\nwill readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these\r\ndays of free education and encyclop\u00e6dias, is a somewhat rare\r\naccomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should\r\npossess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work,\r\nand this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly,\r\nyou on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my\r\nlimits in a very precise fashion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered, laughing. \u201cIt was a singular document. Philosophy,\r\nastronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany\r\nvariable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region\r\nwithin fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic,\r\nsensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer,\r\nswordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I\r\nthink, were the main points of my analysis.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes grinned at the last item. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI say now, as I said\r\nthen, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all\r\nthe furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in\r\nthe lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it.\r\nNow, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us\r\nto-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me\r\ndown the letter K of the _American Encyclop\u00e6dia_ which stands upon the\r\nshelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see\r\nwhat may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a\r\nstrong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason\r\nfor leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their\r\nhabits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the\r\nlonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude\r\nin England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or\r\nsomething, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of\r\nsomeone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he\r\nfeared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters\r\nwhich were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the\r\npostmarks of those letters?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third\r\nfrom London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom East London. What do you deduce from that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the\r\nprobability\u2014the strong probability\u2014is that the writer was on board of a\r\nship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of\r\nPondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment,\r\nin Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest\r\nanything?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA greater distance to travel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the letter had also a greater distance to come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I do not see the point.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or\r\nmen are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their\r\nsingular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.\r\nYou see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from\r\nDundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have\r\narrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven\r\nweeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the\r\ndifference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the\r\nsailing vessel which brought the writer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMore than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of\r\nthis new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has\r\nalways fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to\r\ntravel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we\r\ncannot count upon delay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood God!\u201d I cried. \u201cWhat can it mean, this relentless persecution?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to\r\nthe person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite\r\nclear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not\r\nhave carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner\u2019s\r\njury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men\r\nof resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the\r\nholder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be\r\nthe initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut of what society?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you never\u2014\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his\r\nvoice\u2014\u201chave you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never have.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. \u201cHere it is,\u201d\r\nsaid he presently:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the\r\nsound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was\r\nformed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the\r\nCivil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of\r\nthe country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia,\r\nand Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for\r\nthe terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from\r\nthe country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were\r\nusually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic\r\nbut generally recognised shape\u2014a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts,\r\nmelon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim\r\nmight either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the\r\ncountry. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon\r\nhim, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was\r\nthe organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that\r\nthere is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving\r\nit with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to\r\nthe perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite\r\nof the efforts of the United States government and of the better\r\nclasses of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869,\r\nthe movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been\r\nsporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will observe,\u201d said Holmes, laying down the volume, \u201cthat the\r\nsudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance\r\nof Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause\r\nand effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the\r\nmore implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this\r\nregister and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South,\r\nand that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is\r\nrecovered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen the page we have seen\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, \u2018sent the\r\npips to A, B, and C\u2019\u2014that is, sent the society\u2019s warning to them. Then\r\nthere are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country,\r\nand finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C.\r\nWell, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place,\r\nand I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime\r\nis to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to\r\nbe done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget\r\nfor half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable\r\nways of our fellow men.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued\r\nbrightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.\r\nSherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse me for not waiting for you,\u201d said he; \u201cI have, I\r\nforesee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young\r\nOpenshaw\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat steps will you take?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may\r\nhave to go down to Horsham, after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not go there first?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid\r\nwill bring up your coffee.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced\r\nmy eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I cried, \u201cyou are too late.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said he, laying down his cup, \u201cI feared as much. How was it\r\ndone?\u201d He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading \u2018Tragedy Near\r\nWaterloo Bridge.\u2019 Here is the account:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H\r\nDivision, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a\r\nsplash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy,\r\nso that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite\r\nimpossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by\r\nthe aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It\r\nproved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from\r\nan envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose\r\nresidence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been\r\nhurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that\r\nin his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked\r\nover the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats.\r\nThe body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt\r\nthat the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which\r\nshould have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to\r\nthe condition of the riverside landing-stages.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken\r\nthan I had ever seen him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat hurts my pride, Watson,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt is a petty feeling,\r\nno doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me\r\nnow, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang.\r\nThat he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to\r\nhis death\u2014!\u201d He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in\r\nuncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a\r\nnervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey must be cunning devils,\u201d he exclaimed at last. \u201cHow could they\r\nhave decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line\r\nto the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a\r\nnight, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in\r\nthe long run. I am going out now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the police?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take\r\nthe flies, but not before.\u201d\r\n\r\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the\r\nevening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come\r\nback yet. It was nearly ten o\u2019clock before he entered, looking pale and\r\nworn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf\r\nhe devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are hungry,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cStarving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since\r\nbreakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bite. I had no time to think of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how have you succeeded?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a clue?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long\r\nremain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark\r\nupon them. It is well thought of!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he\r\nsqueezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust\r\nthem into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote \u201cS. H. for J.\r\nO.\u201d Then he sealed it and addressed it to \u201cCaptain James Calhoun,\r\nBarque _Lone Star_, Savannah, Georgia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will await him when he enters port,\u201d said he, chuckling. \u201cIt may\r\ngive him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his\r\nfate as Openshaw did before him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who is this Captain Calhoun?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you trace it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates\r\nand names.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have spent the whole day,\u201d said he, \u201cover Lloyd\u2019s registers and\r\nfiles of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel\r\nwhich touched at Pondicherry in January and February in \u201983. There were\r\nthirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those\r\nmonths. Of these, one, the _Lone Star_, instantly attracted my\r\nattention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from\r\nLondon, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the\r\nUnion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTexas, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an\r\nAmerican origin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque _Lone\r\nStar_ was there in January, \u201985, my suspicion became a certainty. I\r\nthen inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of\r\nLondon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe _Lone Star_ had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert\r\nDock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide\r\nthis morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and\r\nlearned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly\r\nI have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from\r\nthe Isle of Wight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat will you do, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the\r\nonly native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and\r\nGermans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last\r\nnight. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By\r\nthe time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will\r\nhave carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police\r\nof Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a\r\ncharge of murder.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the\r\nmurderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which\r\nwould show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves,\r\nwas upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial\r\ngales that year. We waited long for news of the _Lone Star_ of\r\nSavannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere\r\nfar out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen\r\nswinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters \u201cL. S.\u201d carved upon\r\nit, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the _Lone\r\nStar_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP\r\n\r\n\r\nIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the\r\nTheological College of St. George\u2019s, was much addicted to opium. The\r\nhabit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he\r\nwas at college; for having read De Quincey\u2019s description of his dreams\r\nand sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt\r\nto produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that\r\nthe practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years\r\nhe continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and\r\npity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow,\r\npasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a\r\nchair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.\r\n\r\nOne night\u2014it was in June, \u201989\u2014there came a ring to my bell, about the\r\nhour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up\r\nin my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made\r\na little face of disappointment.\r\n\r\n\u201cA patient!\u201d said she. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to go out.\u201d\r\n\r\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\r\n\r\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon\r\nthe linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some\r\ndark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse my calling so late,\u201d she began, and then, suddenly\r\nlosing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my\r\nwife\u2019s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. \u201cOh, I\u2019m in such trouble!\u201d\r\nshe cried; \u201cI do so want a little help.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said my wife, pulling up her veil, \u201cit is Kate Whitney. How you\r\nstartled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do, so I came straight to you.\u201d That was always\r\nthe way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a\r\nlighthouse.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and\r\nwater, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you\r\nrather that I sent James off to bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, no! I want the doctor\u2019s advice and help, too. It\u2019s about Isa.\r\nHe has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband\u2019s\r\ntrouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school\r\ncompanion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find.\r\nDid she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring\r\nhim back to her?\r\n\r\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he\r\nhad, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest\r\neast of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one\r\nday, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But\r\nnow the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay\r\nthere, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison\r\nor sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of\r\nit, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do?\r\nHow could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place\r\nand pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?\r\n\r\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it.\r\nMight I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought,\r\nwhy should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney\u2019s medical adviser, and as\r\nsuch I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were\r\nalone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab\r\nwithin two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given\r\nme. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery\r\nsitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a\r\nstrange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only\r\ncould show how strange it was to be.\r\n\r\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.\r\nUpper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves\r\nwhich line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge.\r\nBetween a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of\r\nsteps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the\r\nden of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down\r\nthe steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken\r\nfeet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found\r\nthe latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with\r\nthe brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the\r\nforecastle of an emigrant ship.\r\n\r\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in\r\nstrange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown\r\nback, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark,\r\nlack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows\r\nthere glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as\r\nthe burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The\r\nmost lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked\r\ntogether in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming\r\nin gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling\r\nout his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his\r\nneighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal,\r\nbeside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old\r\nman, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his\r\nknees, staring into the fire.\r\n\r\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for\r\nme and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I have not come to stay,\u201d said I. \u201cThere is a friend of\r\nmine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering\r\nthrough the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring\r\nout at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God! It\u2019s Watson,\u201d said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction,\r\nwith every nerve in a twitter. \u201cI say, Watson, what o\u2019clock is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNearly eleven.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf what day?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf Friday, June 19th.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d\u2019you\r\nwant to frighten a chap for?\u201d He sank his face onto his arms and began\r\nto sob in a high treble key.\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two\r\ndays for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I am. But you\u2019ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few\r\nhours, three pipes, four pipes\u2014I forget how many. But I\u2019ll go home with\r\nyou. I wouldn\u2019t frighten Kate\u2014poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have\r\nyou a cab?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have one waiting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe,\r\nWatson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers,\r\nholding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug,\r\nand looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by\r\nthe brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice\r\nwhispered, \u201cWalk past me, and then look back at me.\u201d The words fell\r\nquite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come\r\nfrom the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever,\r\nvery thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down\r\nfrom between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude\r\nfrom his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all\r\nmy self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of\r\nastonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I.\r\nHis form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had\r\nregained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my\r\nsurprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion\r\nto me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round\r\nto the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped\r\nsenility.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes!\u201d I whispered, \u201cwhat on earth are you doing in this den?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs low as you can,\u201d he answered; \u201cI have excellent ears. If you would\r\nhave the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I\r\nshould be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a cab outside.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he\r\nappears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you\r\nalso to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have\r\nthrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with\r\nyou in five minutes.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes\u2019 requests, for they\r\nwere always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet\r\nair of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in\r\nthe cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I\r\ncould not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in\r\none of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his\r\nexistence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney\u2019s bill,\r\nled him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a\r\nvery short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I\r\nwas walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he\r\nshuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing\r\nquickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit\r\nof laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you imagine that I have added\r\nopium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little\r\nweaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was certainly surprised to find you there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut not more so than I to find you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI came to find a friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I to find an enemy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn enemy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.\r\nBriefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I\r\nhave hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as\r\nI have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would\r\nnot have been worth an hour\u2019s purchase; for I have used it before now\r\nfor my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to\r\nhave vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that\r\nbuilding, near the corner of Paul\u2019s Wharf, which could tell some\r\nstrange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! You do not mean bodies?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had \u00a3 1000 for every\r\npoor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest\r\nmurder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair\r\nhas entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.\u201d He\r\nput his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly\u2014a signal\r\nwhich was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed\r\nshortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses\u2019 hoofs.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the\r\ngloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side\r\nlanterns. \u201cYou\u2019ll come with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I can be of use.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.\r\nMy room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Cedars?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; that is Mr. St. Clair\u2019s house. I am staying there while I conduct\r\nthe inquiry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNear Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I am all in the dark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course you are. You\u2019ll know all about it presently. Jump up here.\r\nAll right, John; we shall not need you. Here\u2019s half a crown. Look out\r\nfor me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the\r\nendless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened\r\ngradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with\r\nthe murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull\r\nwilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,\r\nregular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some\r\nbelated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the\r\nsky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts\r\nof the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his\r\nbreast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside\r\nhim, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax\r\nhis powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of\r\nhis thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to\r\nthe fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself,\r\nshrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who\r\nhas satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a grand gift of silence, Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cIt makes you\r\nquite invaluable as a companion. \u2019Pon my word, it is a great thing for\r\nme to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not\r\nover-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little\r\nwoman to-night when she meets me at the door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou forget that I know nothing about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get\r\nto Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to\r\ngo upon. There\u2019s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can\u2019t get the end of\r\nit into my hand. Now, I\u2019ll state the case clearly and concisely to you,\r\nWatson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cProceed, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome years ago\u2014to be definite, in May, 1884\u2014there came to Lee a\r\ngentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of\r\nmoney. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and\r\nlived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the\r\nneighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer,\r\nby whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was\r\ninterested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the\r\nmorning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St.\r\nClair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a\r\ngood husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with\r\nall who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment,\r\nas far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to \u00a3 88 10_s_., while\r\nhe has \u00a3 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.\r\nThere is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been\r\nweighing upon his mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than\r\nusual, remarking before he started that he had two important\r\ncommissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a\r\nbox of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram\r\nupon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect\r\nthat a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting\r\nwas waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.\r\nNow, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office\r\nof the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam\r\nLane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch,\r\nstarted for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company\u2019s\r\noffice, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking\r\nthrough Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed\r\nme so far?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very clear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair\r\nwalked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did\r\nnot like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was\r\nwalking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an\r\nejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down\r\nat her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor\r\nwindow. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she\r\ndescribes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to\r\nher, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to\r\nher that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from\r\nbehind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that\r\nalthough he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he\r\nhad on neither collar nor necktie.\r\n\r\n\u201cConvinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the\r\nsteps\u2014for the house was none other than the opium den in which you\r\nfound me to-night\u2014and running through the front room she attempted to\r\nascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the\r\nstairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken,\r\nwho thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there,\r\npushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts\r\nand fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in\r\nFresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their\r\nway to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and\r\nin spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their\r\nway to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no\r\nsign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one\r\nto be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems,\r\nmade his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one\r\nelse had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was\r\ntheir denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to\r\nbelieve that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she\r\nsprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid\r\nfrom it. Out there fell a cascade of children\u2019s bricks. It was the toy\r\nwhich he had promised to bring home.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,\r\nmade the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were\r\ncarefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The\r\nfront room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small\r\nbedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between\r\nthe wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low\r\ntide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of\r\nwater. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On\r\nexamination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and\r\nseveral scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the\r\nbedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the\r\nclothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His\r\nboots, his socks, his hat, and his watch\u2014all were there. There were no\r\nsigns of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other\r\ntraces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently\r\nhave gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous\r\nbloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save\r\nhimself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment\r\nof the tragedy.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in\r\nthe matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents,\r\nbut as, by Mrs. St. Clair\u2019s story, he was known to have been at the\r\nfoot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband\u2019s appearance\r\nat the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the\r\ncrime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that\r\nhe had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and\r\nthat he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing\r\ngentleman\u2019s clothes.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives\r\nupon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last\r\nhuman being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh\r\nBoone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who\r\ngoes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to\r\navoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax\r\nvestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the\r\nleft-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in\r\nthe wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,\r\ncross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a\r\npiteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy\r\nleather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the\r\nfellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional\r\nacquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has\r\nreaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that\r\nno one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a\r\npale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has\r\nturned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair\r\nof very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the\r\ncolour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of\r\nmendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply\r\nto any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by.\r\nThis is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium\r\nden, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are\r\nin quest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut a cripple!\u201d said I. \u201cWhat could he have done single-handed against\r\na man in the prime of life?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other\r\nrespects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your\r\nmedical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is\r\noften compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray continue your narrative.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,\r\nand she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could\r\nbe of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who\r\nhad charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the\r\npremises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the\r\nmatter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as\r\nhe was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated\r\nwith his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he\r\nwas seized and searched, without anything being found which could\r\nincriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his\r\nright shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been\r\ncut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there,\r\nadding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the\r\nstains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same\r\nsource. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair\r\nand swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a\r\nmystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair\u2019s assertion that\r\nshe had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she\r\nmust have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly\r\nprotesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon\r\nthe premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh\r\nclue.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had\r\nfeared to find. It was Neville St. Clair\u2019s coat, and not Neville St.\r\nClair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think\r\nthey found in the pockets?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies\r\nand half-pennies\u2014421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder\r\nthat it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a\r\ndifferent matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the\r\nhouse. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when\r\nthe stripped body had been sucked away into the river.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.\r\nWould the body be dressed in a coat alone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that\r\nthis man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there\r\nis no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then?\r\nIt would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the\r\ntell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of\r\nthrowing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not\r\nsink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when\r\nthe wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard\r\nfrom his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.\r\nThere is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard,\r\nwhere he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all\r\nthe coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure\r\nof the coat\u2019s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same\r\nwith the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and\r\nonly just had time to close the window when the police appeared.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt certainly sounds feasible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.\r\nBoone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but\r\nit could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against\r\nhim. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life\r\nappeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter\r\nstands at present, and the questions which have to be solved\u2014what\r\nNeville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when\r\nthere, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his\r\ndisappearance\u2014are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I\r\ncannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first\r\nglance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of\r\nevents, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town\r\nuntil the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled\r\nalong with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished,\r\nhowever, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights\r\nstill glimmered in the windows.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are on the outskirts of Lee,\u201d said my companion. \u201cWe have touched\r\non three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex,\r\npassing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light\r\namong the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman\r\nwhose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink\r\nof our horse\u2019s feet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St.\r\nClair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest\r\nassured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and\r\ncolleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her\r\nhusband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own\r\ngrounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse\u2019s head, and springing\r\ndown, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to\r\nthe house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde\r\nwoman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de\r\nsoie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She\r\nstood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand\r\nupon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly\r\nbent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a\r\nstanding question.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d she cried, \u201cwell?\u201d And then, seeing that there were two of us,\r\nshe gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my\r\ncompanion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo good news?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo bad?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a\r\nlong day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in\r\nseveral of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to\r\nbring him out and associate him with this investigation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am delighted to see you,\u201d said she, pressing my hand warmly. \u201cYou\r\nwill, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our\r\narrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly\r\nupon us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear madam,\u201d said I, \u201cI am an old campaigner, and if I were not I\r\ncan very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any\r\nassistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed\r\nhappy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d said the lady as we entered a well-lit\r\ndining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out,\r\n\u201cI should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to\r\nwhich I beg that you will give a plain answer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, madam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to\r\nfainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUpon what point?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. \u201cFrankly,\r\nnow!\u201d she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at\r\nhim as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrankly, then, madam, I do not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think that he is dead?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMurdered?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t say that. Perhaps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd on what day did he meet his death?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn Monday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is\r\nthat I have received a letter from him to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d he roared.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, to-day.\u201d She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I see it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the\r\ntable he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my\r\nchair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very\r\ncoarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the\r\ndate of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was\r\nconsiderably after midnight.\r\n\r\n\u201cCoarse writing,\u201d murmured Holmes. \u201cSurely this is not your husband\u2019s\r\nwriting, madam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but the enclosure is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and\r\ninquire as to the address.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can you tell that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.\r\nThe rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has\r\nbeen used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none\r\nwould be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and\r\nthere has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only\r\nmean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but\r\nthere is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter.\r\nHa! there has been an enclosure here!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you are sure that this is your husband\u2019s hand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of his hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing,\r\nand yet I know it well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge\r\nerror which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in\r\npatience.\u2014NEVILLE.\u2019 Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book,\r\noctavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man\r\nwith a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very\r\nmuch in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have\r\nno doubt that it is your husband\u2019s hand, madam?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone. Neville wrote those words.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the\r\nclouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is\r\nover.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUnless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The\r\nring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no; it is, it is his very own writing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only\r\nposted to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf so, much may have happened between.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well\r\nwith him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if\r\nevil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself\r\nin the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly\r\nwith the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think\r\nthat I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his\r\ndeath?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be\r\nmore valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in\r\nthis letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to\r\ncorroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write\r\nletters, why should he remain away from you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery much so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas the window open?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen he might have called to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe might.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA call for help, you thought?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. He waved his hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the\r\nunexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you thought he was pulled back?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe disappeared so suddenly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the\r\nLascar was at the foot of the stairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary\r\nclothes on?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which\r\nI wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and\r\nthen retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our\r\ndisposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after\r\nmy night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he\r\nhad an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for\r\na week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking\r\nat it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or\r\nconvinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident\r\nto me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off\r\nhis coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then\r\nwandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions\r\nfrom the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of\r\nEastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an\r\nounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In\r\nthe dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe\r\nbetween his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the\r\nceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with\r\nthe light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I\r\ndropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me\r\nto wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The\r\npipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the\r\nroom was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap\r\nof shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\r\n\r\n\u201cAwake, Watson?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGame for a morning drive?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy\r\nsleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.\u201d He chuckled to himself as\r\nhe spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the\r\nsombre thinker of the previous night.\r\n\r\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was\r\nstirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished\r\nwhen Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to test a little theory of mine,\u201d said he, pulling on his\r\nboots. \u201cI think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of\r\none of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from\r\nhere to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd where is it?\u201d I asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the bathroom,\u201d he answered. \u201cOh, yes, I am not joking,\u201d he\r\ncontinued, seeing my look of incredulity. \u201cI have just been there, and\r\nI have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on,\r\nmy boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the\r\nbright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the\r\nhalf-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away\r\nwe dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring,\r\nbearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on\r\neither side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has been in some points a singular case,\u201d said Holmes, flicking the\r\nhorse on into a gallop. \u201cI confess that I have been as blind as a mole,\r\nbut it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from\r\ntheir windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side.\r\nPassing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and\r\ndashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found\r\nourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force,\r\nand the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the\r\nhorse\u2019s head while the other led us in.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is on duty?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cInspector Bradstreet, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, Bradstreet, how are you?\u201d A tall, stout official had come down the\r\nstone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. \u201cI wish to\r\nhave a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table,\r\nand a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI called about that beggarman, Boone\u2014the one who was charged with\r\nbeing concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I heard. You have him here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the cells.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he quiet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDirty?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is\r\nas black as a tinker\u2019s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he\r\nwill have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would\r\nagree with me that he needed it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to see him very much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your\r\nbag.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I think that I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good. Come this way, if you please.\u201d He led us down a passage,\r\nopened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a\r\nwhitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe third on the right is his,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cHere it is!\u201d He\r\nquietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is asleep,\u201d said he. \u201cYou can see him very well.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face\r\ntowards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was\r\na middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a\r\ncoloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He\r\nwas, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which\r\ncovered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad\r\nwheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its\r\ncontraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three\r\nteeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red\r\nhair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a beauty, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said the inspector.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe certainly needs a wash,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cI had an idea that he\r\nmight, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.\u201d He opened\r\nthe Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very\r\nlarge bath-sponge.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe! he! You are a funny one,\u201d chuckled the inspector.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very\r\nquietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know why not,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look a\r\ncredit to the Bow Street cells, does he?\u201d He slipped his key into the\r\nlock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half\r\nturned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes\r\nstooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it\r\ntwice vigorously across and down the prisoner\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me introduce you,\u201d he shouted, \u201cto Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee,\r\nin the county of Kent.\u201d\r\n\r\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man\u2019s face peeled off\r\nunder the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown\r\ntint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and\r\nthe twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A\r\ntwitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his\r\nbed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and\r\nsmooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy\r\nbewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a\r\nscream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat heavens!\u201d cried the inspector, \u201cit is, indeed, the missing man.\r\nI know him from the photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself\r\nto his destiny. \u201cBe it so,\u201d said he. \u201cAnd pray what am I charged with?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith making away with Mr. Neville St.\u2014 Oh, come, you can\u2019t be charged\r\nwith that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,\u201d said the\r\ninspector with a grin. \u201cWell, I have been twenty-seven years in the\r\nforce, but this really takes the cake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has\r\nbeen committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo crime, but a very great error has been committed,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\u201cYou would have done better to have trusted your wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was not the wife; it was the children,\u201d groaned the prisoner. \u201cGod\r\nhelp me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an\r\nexposure! What can I do?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly\r\non the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,\u201d said he,\r\n\u201cof course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you\r\nconvince the police authorities that there is no possible case against\r\nyou, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should\r\nfind their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure,\r\nmake notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the\r\nproper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod bless you!\u201d cried the prisoner passionately. \u201cI would have endured\r\nimprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable\r\nsecret as a family blot to my children.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a\r\nschoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education.\r\nI travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a\r\nreporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to\r\nhave a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I\r\nvolunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my\r\nadventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I\r\ncould get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I\r\nhad, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been\r\nfamous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my\r\nattainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as\r\npossible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by\r\nthe aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head\r\nof hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business\r\npart of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar.\r\nFor seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the\r\nevening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26_s_.\r\n4_d_.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some\r\ntime later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me\r\nfor \u00a3 25. I was at my wit\u2019s end where to get the money, but a sudden\r\nidea came to me. I begged a fortnight\u2019s grace from the creditor, asked\r\nfor a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the\r\nCity under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work\r\nat \u00a3 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by\r\nsmearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and\r\nsitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but\r\nthe dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day\r\nin the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly\r\nface and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret.\r\nHe was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam\r\nLane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the\r\nevenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This\r\nfellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew\r\nthat my secret was safe in his possession.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.\r\nI do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn \u00a3 700\r\na year\u2014which is less than my average takings\u2014but I had exceptional\r\nadvantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of\r\nrepartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised\r\ncharacter in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,\r\npoured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take\r\n\u00a3 2.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,\r\nand eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real\r\noccupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She\r\nlittle knew what.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room\r\nabove the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my\r\nhorror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with\r\nher eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms\r\nto cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated\r\nhim to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice\r\ndownstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off\r\nmy clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and\r\nwig. Even a wife\u2019s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But\r\nthen it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and\r\nthat the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by\r\nmy violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the\r\nbedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the\r\ncoppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in\r\nwhich I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it\r\ndisappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but\r\nat that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few\r\nminutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of\r\nbeing identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his\r\nmurderer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was\r\ndetermined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my\r\npreference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly\r\nanxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a\r\nmoment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried\r\nscrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat note only reached her yesterday,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood God! What a week she must have spent!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe police have watched this Lascar,\u201d said Inspector Bradstreet, \u201cand\r\nI can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter\r\nunobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who\r\nforgot all about it for some days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was it,\u201d said Holmes, nodding approvingly; \u201cI have no doubt of\r\nit. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMany times; but what was a fine to me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must stop here, however,\u201d said Bradstreet. \u201cIf the police are to\r\nhush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be\r\ntaken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure,\r\nMr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared\r\nthe matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reached this one,\u201d said my friend, \u201cby sitting upon five pillows and\r\nconsuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker\r\nStreet we shall just be in time for breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE\r\n\r\n\r\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning\r\nafter Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of\r\nthe season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a\r\npipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled\r\nmorning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch\r\nwas a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and\r\ndisreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in\r\nseveral places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair\r\nsuggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the\r\npurpose of examination.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are engaged,\u201d said I; \u201cperhaps I interrupt you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my\r\nresults. The matter is a perfectly trivial one\u201d\u2014he jerked his thumb in\r\nthe direction of the old hat\u2014\u201cbut there are points in connection with\r\nit which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.\u201d\r\n\r\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his\r\ncrackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were\r\nthick with the ice crystals. \u201cI suppose,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthat, homely as\r\nit looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it\u2014that it is\r\nthe clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the\r\npunishment of some crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no. No crime,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \u201cOnly one of those\r\nwhimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million\r\nhuman beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square\r\nmiles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity,\r\nevery possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and\r\nmany a little problem will be presented which may be striking and\r\nbizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of\r\nsuch.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much so,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthat of the last six cases which I have\r\nadded to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers,\r\nto the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of\r\nthe man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small\r\nmatter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson,\r\nthe commissionaire?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is to him that this trophy belongs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is his hat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look\r\nupon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem.\r\nAnd, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning,\r\nin company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting\r\nat this moment in front of Peterson\u2019s fire. The facts are these: about\r\nfour o\u2019clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a\r\nvery honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was\r\nmaking his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he\r\nsaw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and\r\ncarrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the\r\ncorner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a\r\nlittle knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man\u2019s hat, on\r\nwhich he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his\r\nhead, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward\r\nto protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at\r\nhaving broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in\r\nuniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and\r\nvanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of\r\nTottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of\r\nPeterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and\r\nalso of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a\r\nmost unimpeachable Christmas goose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich surely he restored to their owner?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that \u2018For Mrs.\r\nHenry Baker\u2019 was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird\u2019s\r\nleft leg, and it is also true that the initials \u2018H. B.\u2019 are legible\r\nupon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers,\r\nand some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy\r\nto restore lost property to any one of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, then, did Peterson do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,\r\nknowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The\r\ngoose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in\r\nspite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten\r\nwithout unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to\r\nfulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the\r\nhat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid he not advertise?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, what clue could you have as to his identity?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly as much as we can deduce.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom his hat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as\r\nto the individuality of the man who has worn this article?\u201d\r\n\r\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather\r\nruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape,\r\nhard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but\r\nwas a good deal discoloured. There was no maker\u2019s name; but, as Holmes\r\nhad remarked, the initials \u201cH. B.\u201d were scrawled upon one side. It was\r\npierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For\r\nthe rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several\r\nplaces, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the\r\ndiscoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can see nothing,\u201d said I, handing it back to my friend.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to\r\nreason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your\r\ninferences.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion\r\nwhich was characteristic of him. \u201cIt is perhaps less suggestive than it\r\nmight have been,\u201d he remarked, \u201cand yet there are a few inferences\r\nwhich are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a\r\nstrong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is\r\nof course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly\r\nwell-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon\r\nevil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing\r\nto a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his\r\nfortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at\r\nwork upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife\r\nhas ceased to love him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,\u201d he continued,\r\ndisregarding my remonstrance. \u201cHe is a man who leads a sedentary life,\r\ngoes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has\r\ngrizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which\r\nhe anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are\r\nto be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely\r\nimprobable that he has gas laid on in his house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are certainly joking, Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these\r\nresults, you are unable to see how they are attained?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am\r\nunable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was\r\nintellectual?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the\r\nforehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. \u201cIt is a question of\r\ncubic capacity,\u201d said he; \u201ca man with so large a brain must have\r\nsomething in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe decline of his fortunes, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came\r\nin then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of\r\nribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy\r\nso expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he\r\nhas assuredly gone down in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and\r\nthe moral retrogression?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes laughed. \u201cHere is the foresight,\u201d said he putting his\r\nfinger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. \u201cThey are\r\nnever sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a\r\ncertain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this\r\nprecaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the\r\nelastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has\r\nless foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a\r\nweakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some\r\nof these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign\r\nthat he has not entirely lost his self-respect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour reasoning is certainly plausible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,\r\nthat it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to\r\nbe gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining.\r\nThe lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the\r\nscissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a\r\ndistinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the\r\ngritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,\r\nshowing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the\r\nmarks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer\r\nperspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of\r\ntraining.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut his wife\u2014you said that she had ceased to love him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear\r\nWatson, with a week\u2019s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your\r\nwife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also\r\nhave been unfortunate enough to lose your wife\u2019s affection.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he might be a bachelor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.\r\nRemember the card upon the bird\u2019s leg.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that\r\nthe gas is not laid on in his house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no\r\nless than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the\r\nindividual must be brought into frequent contact with burning\r\ntallow\u2014walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a\r\nguttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from\r\na gas-jet. Are you satisfied?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is very ingenious,\u201d said I, laughing; \u201cbut since, as you said\r\njust now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the\r\nloss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open,\r\nand Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with\r\nflushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!\u201d he gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cEh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through\r\nthe kitchen window?\u201d Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get\r\na fairer view of the man\u2019s excited face.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!\u201d He held out his\r\nhand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly\r\nscintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of\r\nsuch purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the\r\ndark hollow of his hand.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. \u201cBy Jove, Peterson!\u201d said he,\r\n\u201cthis is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were\r\nputty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than a precious stone. It is _the_ precious stone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot the Countess of Morcar\u2019s blue carbuncle!\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have\r\nread the advertisement about it in _The Times_ every day lately. It is\r\nabsolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the\r\nreward offered of \u00a3 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of\r\nthe market price.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!\u201d The commissionaire plumped\r\ndown into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are\r\nsentimental considerations in the background which would induce the\r\nCountess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the\r\ngem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,\u201d I\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a\r\nplumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady\u2019s\r\njewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has\r\nbeen referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I\r\nbelieve.\u201d He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates,\r\nuntil at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the\r\nfollowing paragraph:\r\n\r\n\u201cHotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was\r\nbrought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted\r\nfrom the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as\r\nthe blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his\r\nevidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room\r\nof the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he\r\nmight solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had\r\nremained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called\r\naway. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the\r\nbureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in\r\nwhich, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep\r\nher jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly\r\ngave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone\r\ncould not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine\r\nCusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder\u2019s cry of\r\ndismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,\r\nwhere she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector\r\nBradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who\r\nstruggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest\r\nterms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given\r\nagainst the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the\r\noffence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of\r\nintense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion\r\nand was carried out of court.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum! So much for the police-court,\u201d said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing\r\naside the paper. \u201cThe question for us now to solve is the sequence of\r\nevents leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a\r\ngoose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little\r\ndeductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less\r\ninnocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and\r\nthe goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and\r\nall the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we\r\nmust set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and\r\nascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do\r\nthis, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly\r\nin an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall\r\nhave recourse to other methods.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat will you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: \u2018Found at the\r\ncorner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker\r\ncan have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker\r\nStreet.\u2019 That is clear and concise.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery. But will he see it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man,\r\nthe loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in\r\nbreaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of\r\nnothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the\r\nimpulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the\r\nintroduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who\r\nknows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run\r\ndown to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening\r\npapers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn which, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, in the _Globe_, _Star_, _Pall Mall_, _St. James\u2019s Gazette_,\r\n_Evening News_, _Standard_, _Echo_, and any others that occur to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, sir. And this stone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just\r\nbuy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must\r\nhave one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your\r\nfamily is now devouring.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it\r\nagainst the light. \u201cIt\u2019s a bonny thing,\u201d said he. \u201cJust see how it\r\nglints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.\r\nEvery good stone is. They are the devil\u2019s pet baits. In the larger and\r\nolder jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not\r\nyet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in\r\nsouthern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the\r\ncarbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite\r\nof its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two\r\nmurders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought\r\nabout for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.\r\nWho would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows\r\nand the prison? I\u2019ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to\r\nthe Countess to say that we have it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think that this man Horner is innocent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had\r\nanything to do with the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely\r\ninnocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was\r\nof considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That,\r\nhowever, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer\r\nto our advertisement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you can do nothing until then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come\r\nback in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like\r\nto see the solution of so tangled a business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe.\r\nBy the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs.\r\nHudson to examine its crop.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six\r\nwhen I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the\r\nhouse I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was\r\nbuttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which\r\nwas thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened,\r\nand we were shown up together to Holmes\u2019 room.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Henry Baker, I believe,\u201d said he, rising from his armchair and\r\ngreeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so\r\nreadily assume. \u201cPray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a\r\ncold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for\r\nsummer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right\r\ntime. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad,\r\nintelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A\r\ntouch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended\r\nhand, recalled Holmes\u2019 surmise as to his habits. His rusty black\r\nfrock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up,\r\nand his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff\r\nor shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with\r\ncare, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and\r\nletters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have retained these things for some days,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cbecause we\r\nexpected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at\r\na loss to know now why you did not advertise.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. \u201cShillings have not been so\r\nplentiful with me as they once were,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI had no doubt that\r\nthe gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the\r\nbird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at\r\nrecovering them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo eat it!\u201d Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I\r\npresume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the\r\nsame weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally\r\nwell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, certainly, certainly,\u201d answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your\r\nown bird, so if you wish\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. \u201cThey might be useful to me as\r\nrelics of my adventure,\u201d said he, \u201cbut beyond that I can hardly see\r\nwhat use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be\r\nto me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my\r\nattentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is your hat, then, and there your bird,\u201d said he. \u201cBy the way,\r\nwould it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am\r\nsomewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown\r\ngoose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, sir,\u201d said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained\r\nproperty under his arm. \u201cThere are a few of us who frequent the Alpha\r\nInn, near the Museum\u2014we are to be found in the Museum itself during the\r\nday, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name,\r\ninstituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence\r\nevery week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were\r\nduly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you,\r\nsir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.\u201d\r\nWith a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and\r\nstrode off upon his way.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much for Mr. Henry Baker,\u201d said Holmes when he had closed the door\r\nbehind him. \u201cIt is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about\r\nthe matter. Are you hungry, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot particularly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up\r\nthis clue while it is still hot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy all means.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats\r\nabout our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a\r\ncloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke\r\nlike so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as\r\nwe swung through the doctors\u2019 quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street,\r\nand so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an\r\nhour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small\r\npublic-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into\r\nHolborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two\r\nglasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,\u201d said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy geese!\u201d The man seemed surprised.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was\r\na member of your goose club.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them\u2019s not _our_ geese.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! Whose, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed? I know some of them. Which was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBreckinridge is his name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! I don\u2019t know him. Well, here\u2019s your good health landlord, and\r\nprosperity to your house. Good-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow for Mr. Breckinridge,\u201d he continued, buttoning up his coat as we\r\ncame out into the frosty air. \u201cRemember, Watson that though we have so\r\nhomely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the\r\nother a man who will certainly get seven years\u2019 penal servitude unless\r\nwe can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but\r\nconfirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation\r\nwhich has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has\r\nplaced in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to\r\nthe south, then, and quick march!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag\r\nof slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the\r\nname of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man,\r\nwith a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up\r\nthe shutters.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-evening. It\u2019s a cold night,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cSold out of geese, I see,\u201d continued Holmes, pointing at the bare\r\nslabs of marble.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet you have five hundred to-morrow morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s no good.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, but I was recommended to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho by?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe landlord of the Alpha.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?\u201d\r\n\r\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the\r\nsalesman.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, then, mister,\u201d said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo,\r\n\u201cwhat are you driving at? Let\u2019s have it straight, now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese\r\nwhich you supplied to the Alpha.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell then, I shan\u2019t tell you. So now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don\u2019t know why you should\r\nbe so warm over such a trifle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWarm! You\u2019d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I\r\npay good money for a good article there should be an end of the\r\nbusiness; but it\u2019s \u2018Where are the geese?\u2019 and \u2018Who did you sell the\r\ngeese to?\u2019 and \u2018What will you take for the geese?\u2019 One would think they\r\nwere the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over\r\nthem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have no connection with any other people who have been making\r\ninquiries,\u201d said Holmes carelessly. \u201cIf you won\u2019t tell us the bet is\r\noff, that is all. But I\u2019m always ready to back my opinion on a matter\r\nof fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country\r\nbred.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, you\u2019ve lost your fiver, for it\u2019s town bred,\u201d snapped the\r\nsalesman.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing of the kind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cD\u2019you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them\r\never since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the\r\nAlpha were town bred.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never persuade me to believe that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you bet, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I\u2019ll\r\nhave a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. \u201cBring me the books, Bill,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great\r\ngreasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow then, Mr. Cocksure,\u201d said the salesman, \u201cI thought that I was out\r\nof geese, but before I finish you\u2019ll find that there is still one left\r\nin my shop. You see this little book?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D\u2019you see? Well, then,\r\nhere on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their\r\nnames are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You\r\nsee this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town\r\nsuppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road\u2014249,\u201d read Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. \u201cHere you are, \u2018Mrs. Oakshott,\r\n117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, then, what\u2019s the last entry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7_s_. 6_d_.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. There you are. And underneath?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12_s_.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you to say now?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his\r\npocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a\r\nman whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped\r\nunder a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which\r\nwas peculiar to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the \u2018Pink \u2019un\u2019\r\nprotruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,\u201d said\r\nhe. \u201cI daresay that if I had put \u00a3 100 down in front of him, that man\r\nwould not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him\r\nby the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I\r\nfancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains\r\nto be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott\r\nto-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear\r\nfrom what that surly fellow said that there are others besides\r\nourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out\r\nfrom the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little\r\nrat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light\r\nwhich was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the\r\nsalesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists\r\nfiercely at the cringing figure.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of you and your geese,\u201d he shouted. \u201cI wish you were\r\nall at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your\r\nsilly talk I\u2019ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and\r\nI\u2019ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese\r\noff you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; but one of them was mine all the same,\u201d whined the little man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe told me to ask you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I\u2019ve had enough\r\nof it. Get out of this!\u201d He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer\r\nflitted away into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,\u201d whispered Holmes. \u201cCome\r\nwith me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.\u201d Striding\r\nthrough the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring\r\nstalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him\r\nupon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light\r\nthat every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are you, then? What do you want?\u201d he asked in a quavering voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse me,\u201d said Holmes blandly, \u201cbut I could not help\r\noverhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I\r\nthink that I could be of assistance to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other\r\npeople don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you can know nothing of this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some\r\ngeese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman\r\nnamed Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and\r\nby him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,\u201d cried the\r\nlittle fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. \u201cI can\r\nhardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. \u201cIn that case\r\nwe had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept\r\nmarket-place,\u201d said he. \u201cBut pray tell me, before we go farther, who it\r\nis that I have the pleasure of assisting.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated for an instant. \u201cMy name is John Robinson,\u201d he\r\nanswered with a sidelong glance.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no; the real name,\u201d said Holmes sweetly. \u201cIt is always awkward\r\ndoing business with an alias.\u201d\r\n\r\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. \u201cWell then,\u201d said\r\nhe, \u201cmy real name is James Ryder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into\r\nthe cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you\r\nwould wish to know.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with\r\nhalf-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he\r\nis on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into\r\nthe cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker\r\nStreet. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin\r\nbreathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of\r\nhis hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere we are!\u201d said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. \u201cThe\r\nfire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder.\r\nPray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we\r\nsettle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what\r\nbecame of those geese?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which\r\nyou were interested\u2014white, with a black bar across the tail.\u201d\r\n\r\nRyder quivered with emotion. \u201cOh, sir,\u201d he cried, \u201ccan you tell me\r\nwhere it went to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt came here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don\u2019t wonder that you\r\nshould take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead\u2014the\r\nbonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here\r\nin my museum.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his\r\nright hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue\r\ncarbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant,\r\nmany-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain\r\nwhether to claim or to disown it.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe game\u2019s up, Ryder,\u201d said Holmes quietly. \u201cHold up, man, or you\u2019ll\r\nbe into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He\u2019s not\r\ngot blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of\r\nbrandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to\r\nbe sure!\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought\r\na tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened\r\neyes at his accuser.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could\r\npossibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that\r\nlittle may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had\r\nheard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar\u2019s?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,\u201d said he in a crackling\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see\u2014her ladyship\u2019s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden\r\nwealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for\r\nbetter men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means\r\nyou used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very\r\npretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had\r\nbeen concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would\r\nrest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some\r\nsmall job in my lady\u2019s room\u2014you and your confederate Cusack\u2014and you\r\nmanaged that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you\r\nrifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man\r\narrested. You then\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my\r\ncompanion\u2019s knees. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, have mercy!\u201d he shrieked. \u201cThink of\r\nmy father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went\r\nwrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I\u2019ll swear it on a Bible.\r\nOh, don\u2019t bring it into court! For Christ\u2019s sake, don\u2019t!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGet back into your chair!\u201d said Holmes sternly. \u201cIt is very well to\r\ncringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner\r\nin the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge\r\nagainst him will break down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of\r\nthe next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose\r\ninto the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope\r\nof safety.\u201d\r\n\r\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. \u201cI will tell you it just\r\nas it happened, sir,\u201d said he. \u201cWhen Horner had been arrested, it\r\nseemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at\r\nonce, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it\r\ninto their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the\r\nhotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and\r\nI made for my sister\u2019s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and\r\nlived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the\r\nway there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a\r\ndetective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring\r\ndown my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what\r\nwas the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been\r\nupset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard\r\nand smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just\r\nbeen serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell\r\ninto talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what\r\nthey stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two\r\nthings about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where\r\nhe lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn\r\nthe stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the\r\nagonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any\r\nmoment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my\r\nwaistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and\r\nlooking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and\r\nsuddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the\r\nbest detective that ever lived.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of\r\nher geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as\r\ngood as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my\r\nstone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this\r\nI drove one of the birds\u2014a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I\r\ncaught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat\r\nas far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the\r\nstone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature\r\nflapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the\r\nmatter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered\r\noff among the others.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?\u2019 says she.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said I, \u2018you said you\u2019d give me one for Christmas, and I was\r\nfeeling which was the fattest.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 says she, \u2018we\u2019ve set yours aside for you\u2014Jem\u2019s bird, we call it.\r\nIt\u2019s the big white one over yonder. There\u2019s twenty-six of them, which\r\nmakes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Thank you, Maggie,\u2019 says I; \u2018but if it is all the same to you, I\u2019d\r\nrather have that one I was handling just now.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The other is a good three pound heavier,\u2019 said she, \u2018and we fattened\r\nit expressly for you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Never mind. I\u2019ll have the other, and I\u2019ll take it now,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, just as you like,\u2019 said she, a little huffed. \u2018Which is it you\r\nwant, then?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the\r\nflock.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the\r\nway to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it\r\nwas easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and\r\nwe got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for\r\nthere was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake\r\nhad occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister\u2019s, and hurried\r\ninto the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where are they all, Maggie?\u2019 I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Gone to the dealer\u2019s, Jem.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Which dealer\u2019s?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But was there another with a barred tail?\u2019 I asked, \u2018the same as the\r\none I chose?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell\r\nthem apart.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet\r\nwould carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at\r\nonce, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You\r\nheard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like\r\nthat. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am\r\nmyself. And now\u2014and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever\r\nhaving touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me!\r\nGod help me!\u201d He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the\r\nmeasured tapping of Sherlock Holmes\u2019 finger-tips upon the edge of the\r\ntable. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet out!\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more words. Get out!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the\r\nstairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls\r\nfrom the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter all, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay\r\npipe, \u201cI am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If\r\nHorner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will\r\nnot appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am\r\ncommuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.\r\nThis fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.\r\nSend him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides,\r\nit is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most\r\nsingular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If\r\nyou will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin\r\nanother investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief\r\nfeature.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND\r\n\r\n\r\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have\r\nduring the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock\r\nHolmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange,\r\nbut none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his\r\nart than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself\r\nwith any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even\r\nthe fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any\r\nwhich presented more singular features than that which was associated\r\nwith the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The\r\nevents in question occurred in the early days of my association with\r\nHolmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is\r\npossible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a\r\npromise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been\r\nfreed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom\r\nthe pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now\r\ncome to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread\r\nrumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the\r\nmatter even more terrible than the truth.\r\n\r\nIt was early in April in the year \u201983 that I woke one morning to find\r\nSherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was\r\na late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me\r\nthat it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some\r\nsurprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself\r\nregular in my habits.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery sorry to knock you up, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cbut it\u2019s the common lot\r\nthis morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me,\r\nand I on you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, then\u2014a fire?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable\r\nstate of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in\r\nthe sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at\r\nthis hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds,\r\nI presume that it is something very pressing which they have to\r\ncommunicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am\r\nsure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I\r\nshould call you and give you the chance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional\r\ninvestigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as\r\nintuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he\r\nunravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on\r\nmy clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down\r\nto the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who\r\nhad been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-morning, madam,\u201d said Holmes cheerily. \u201cMy name is Sherlock\r\nHolmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before\r\nwhom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see\r\nthat Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up\r\nto it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that\r\nyou are shivering.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not cold which makes me shiver,\u201d said the woman in a low voice,\r\nchanging her seat as requested.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.\u201d She raised her veil as she\r\nspoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of\r\nagitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes,\r\nlike those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of\r\na woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her\r\nexpression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one\r\nof his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must not fear,\u201d said he soothingly, bending forward and patting\r\nher forearm. \u201cWe shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You\r\nhave come in by train this morning, I see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know me, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of\r\nyour left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good\r\ndrive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the\r\nstation.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no mystery, my dear madam,\u201d said he, smiling. \u201cThe left arm\r\nof your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The\r\nmarks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which\r\nthrows up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand\r\nside of the driver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,\u201d said she. \u201cI\r\nstarted from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and\r\ncame in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no\r\nlonger; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to\u2014none,\r\nsave only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little\r\naid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs.\r\nFarintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from\r\nher that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could\r\nhelp me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense\r\ndarkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward\r\nyou for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married,\r\nwith the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find\r\nme ungrateful.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small\r\ncase-book, which he consulted.\r\n\r\n\u201cFarintosh,\u201d said he. \u201cAh yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with\r\nan opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say,\r\nmadam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I\r\ndid to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own\r\nreward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put\r\nto, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay\r\nbefore us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the\r\nmatter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlas!\u201d replied our visitor, \u201cthe very horror of my situation lies in\r\nthe fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so\r\nentirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that\r\neven he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and\r\nadvice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a\r\nnervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing\r\nanswers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can\r\nsee deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may\r\nadvise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am all attention, madam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is\r\nthe last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the\r\nRoylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes nodded his head. \u201cThe name is familiar to me,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe family was at one time among the richest in England, and the\r\nestates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and\r\nHampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive\r\nheirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin\r\nwas eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency.\r\nNothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the\r\ntwo-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy\r\nmortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the\r\nhorrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my\r\nstepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,\r\nobtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a\r\nmedical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional\r\nskill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a\r\nfit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been\r\nperpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and\r\nnarrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term\r\nof imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and\r\ndisappointed man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the\r\nyoung widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister\r\nJulia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of\r\nmy mother\u2019s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money\u2014not less\r\nthan \u00a3 1000 a year\u2014and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely\r\nwhile we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum\r\nshould be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly\r\nafter our return to England my mother died\u2014she was killed eight years\r\nago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his\r\nattempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live\r\nwith him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my\r\nmother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no\r\nobstacle to our happiness.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.\r\nInstead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours,\r\nwho had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in\r\nthe old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came\r\nout save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his\r\npath. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in\r\nthe men of the family, and in my stepfather\u2019s case it had, I believe,\r\nbeen intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of\r\ndisgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court,\r\nuntil at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would\r\nfly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and\r\nabsolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,\r\nand it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather\r\ntogether that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no\r\nfriends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these\r\nvagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land\r\nwhich represent the family estate, and would accept in return the\r\nhospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for\r\nweeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent\r\nover to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and\r\na baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the\r\nvillagers almost as much as their master.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no\r\ngreat pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a\r\nlong time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the\r\ntime of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even\r\nas mine has.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour sister is dead, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to\r\nspeak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have\r\ndescribed, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and\r\nposition. We had, however, an aunt, my mother\u2019s maiden sister, Miss\r\nHonoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally\r\nallowed to pay short visits at this lady\u2019s house. Julia went there at\r\nChristmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to\r\nwhom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when\r\nmy sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within\r\na fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the\r\nterrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed\r\nand his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and\r\nglanced across at his visitor.\r\n\r\n\u201cPray be precise as to details,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is\r\nseared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very\r\nold, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are\r\non the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of\r\nthe buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott\u2019s, the second\r\nmy sister\u2019s, and the third my own. There is no communication between\r\nthem, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself\r\nplain?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerfectly so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal\r\nnight Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he\r\nhad not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the\r\nstrong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her\r\nroom, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time,\r\nchatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o\u2019clock she rose to\r\nleave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tell me, Helen,\u2019 said she, \u2018have you ever heard anyone whistle in the\r\ndead of the night?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Never,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your\r\nsleep?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Certainly not. But why?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the\r\nmorning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has\r\nawakened me. I cannot tell where it came from\u2014perhaps from the next\r\nroom, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you\r\nwhether you had heard it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did\r\nnot hear it also.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.\u2019 She smiled back at\r\nme, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the\r\nlock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWas it your custom always to lock yourselves in\r\nat night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a\r\nbaboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Pray proceed with your statement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune\r\nimpressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you\r\nknow how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely\r\nallied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain\r\nwas beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the\r\nhubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified\r\nwoman. I knew that it was my sister\u2019s voice. I sprang from my bed,\r\nwrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my\r\ndoor I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a\r\nfew moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.\r\nAs I ran down the passage, my sister\u2019s door was unlocked, and revolved\r\nslowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing\r\nwhat was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I\r\nsaw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her\r\nhands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that\r\nof a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that\r\nmoment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She\r\nwrithed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully\r\nconvulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I\r\nbent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never\r\nforget, \u2018Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!\u2019 There\r\nwas something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with\r\nher finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor\u2019s room, but a\r\nfresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling\r\nloudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his\r\ndressing-gown. When he reached my sister\u2019s side she was unconscious,\r\nand though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid\r\nfrom the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and\r\ndied without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful\r\nend of my beloved sister.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d said Holmes, \u201care you sure about this whistle and\r\nmetallic sound? Could you swear to it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my\r\nstrong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale\r\nand the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas your sister dressed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the\r\ncharred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShowing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the\r\nalarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the\r\ncoroner come to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott\u2019s conduct\r\nhad long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any\r\nsatisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been\r\nfastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by\r\nold-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every\r\nnight. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite\r\nsolid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with\r\nthe same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large\r\nstaples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when\r\nshe met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon\r\nher.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow about poison?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe doctors examined her for it, but without success.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though\r\nwhat it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere there gipsies in the plantation at the time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, there are nearly always some there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band\u2014a speckled\r\nband?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,\r\nsometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to\r\nthese very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted\r\nhandkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have\r\nsuggested the strange adjective which she used.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese are very deep waters,\u201d said he; \u201cpray go on with your\r\nnarrative.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately\r\nlonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have\r\nknown for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in\r\nmarriage. His name is Armitage\u2014Percy Armitage\u2014the second son of Mr.\r\nArmitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no\r\nopposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the\r\nspring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the\r\nbuilding, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to\r\nmove into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very\r\nbed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last\r\nnight, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly\r\nheard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the\r\nherald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was\r\nto be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however,\r\nso I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a\r\ndog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead,\r\nfrom whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing\r\nyou and asking your advice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have done wisely,\u201d said my friend. \u201cBut have you told me all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the\r\nhand that lay upon our visitor\u2019s knee. Five little livid spots, the\r\nmarks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have been cruelly used,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. \u201cHe is a\r\nhard man,\u201d she said, \u201cand perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his\r\nhands and stared into the crackling fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very deep business,\u201d he said at last. \u201cThere are a thousand\r\ndetails which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course\r\nof action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to\r\nStoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms\r\nwithout the knowledge of your stepfather?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most\r\nimportant business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and\r\nthat there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now,\r\nbut she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in\r\ntown. But I shall return by the twelve o\u2019clock train, so as to be there\r\nin time for your coming.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small\r\nbusiness matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my\r\ntrouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this\r\nafternoon.\u201d She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided\r\nfrom the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what do you think of it all, Watson?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes,\r\nleaning back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDark enough and sinister enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are\r\nsound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her\r\nsister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious\r\nend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very\r\npeculiar words of the dying woman?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a\r\nband of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the\r\nfact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an\r\ninterest in preventing his stepdaughter\u2019s marriage, the dying allusion\r\nto a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a\r\nmetallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars\r\nthat secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that\r\nthere is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along\r\nthose lines.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what, then, did the gipsies do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see many objections to any such theory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to\r\nStoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal,\r\nor if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our\r\ndoor had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed\r\nhimself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the\r\nprofessional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long\r\nfrock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in\r\nhis hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of\r\nthe doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to\r\nside. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with\r\nthe sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the\r\nother of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,\r\nfleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird\r\nof prey.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich of you is Holmes?\u201d asked this apparition.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,\u201d said my companion\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, Doctor,\u201d said Holmes blandly. \u201cPray take a seat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have\r\ntraced her. What has she been saying to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a little cold for the time of the year,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat has she been saying to you?\u201d screamed the old man furiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I have heard that the crocuses promise well,\u201d continued my\r\ncompanion imperturbably.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! You put me off, do you?\u201d said our new visitor, taking a step\r\nforward and shaking his hunting-crop. \u201cI know you, you scoundrel! I\r\nhave heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes, the busybody!\u201d\r\n\r\nHis smile broadened.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes chuckled heartily. \u201cYour conversation is most entertaining,\u201d\r\nsaid he. \u201cWhen you go out close the door, for there is a decided\r\ndraught.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will go when I have had my say. Don\u2019t you dare to meddle with my\r\naffairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a\r\ndangerous man to fall foul of! See here.\u201d He stepped swiftly forward,\r\nseized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee that you keep yourself out of my grip,\u201d he snarled, and hurling\r\nthe twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe seems a very amiable person,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cI am not\r\nquite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my\r\ngrip was not much more feeble than his own.\u201d As he spoke he picked up\r\nthe steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\r\n\r\n\u201cFancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\r\ndetective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,\r\nhowever, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from\r\nher imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we\r\nshall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors\u2019\r\nCommons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this\r\nmatter.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was nearly one o\u2019clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his\r\nexcursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over\r\nwith notes and figures.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen the will of the deceased wife,\u201d said he. \u201cTo determine its\r\nexact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the\r\ninvestments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the\r\ntime of the wife\u2019s death was little short of \u00a3 1,100, is now, through\r\nthe fall in agricultural prices, not more than \u00a3 750. Each daughter can\r\nclaim an income of \u00a3 250, in case of marriage. It is evident,\r\ntherefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a\r\nmere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very\r\nserious extent. My morning\u2019s work has not been wasted, since it has\r\nproved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way\r\nof anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for\r\ndawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting\r\nourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and\r\ndrive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your\r\nrevolver into your pocket. An Eley\u2019s No. 2 is an excellent argument\r\nwith gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a\r\ntooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,\r\nwhere we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five\r\nmiles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a\r\nbright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and\r\nwayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the\r\nair was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least\r\nthere was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring\r\nand this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in\r\nthe front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his\r\neyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.\r\nSuddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed\r\nover the meadows.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook there!\u201d said he.\r\n\r\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into\r\na grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out\r\nthe grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\r\n\r\n\u201cStoke Moran?\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,\u201d remarked the\r\ndriver.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is some building going on there,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cthat is where we\r\nare going.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s the village,\u201d said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs\r\nsome distance to the left; \u201cbut if you want to get to the house, you\u2019ll\r\nfind it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the\r\nfields. There it is, where the lady is walking.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,\u201d observed Holmes, shading his\r\neyes. \u201cYes, I think we had better do as you suggest.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to\r\nLeatherhead.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought it as well,\u201d said Holmes as we climbed the stile, \u201cthat this\r\nfellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite\r\nbusiness. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see\r\nthat we have been as good as our word.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face\r\nwhich spoke her joy. \u201cI have been waiting so eagerly for you,\u201d she\r\ncried, shaking hands with us warmly. \u201cAll has turned out splendidly.\r\nDr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back\r\nbefore evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have had the pleasure of making the Doctor\u2019s acquaintance,\u201d said\r\nHolmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss\r\nStoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d she cried, \u201che has followed me, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it appears.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will\r\nhe say when he returns?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more\r\ncunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him\r\nto-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt\u2019s at\r\nHarrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us\r\nat once to the rooms which we are to examine.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central\r\nportion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on\r\neach side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked\r\nwith wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of\r\nruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the\r\nright-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the\r\nwindows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that\r\nthis was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected\r\nagainst the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but\r\nthere were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes\r\nwalked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep\r\nattention the outsides of the windows.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the\r\ncentre one to your sister\u2019s, and the one next to the main building to\r\nDr. Roylott\u2019s chamber?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not\r\nseem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my\r\nroom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing\r\nruns the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows\r\nin it, of course?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable\r\nfrom that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room\r\nand bar your shutters?\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the\r\nopen window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but\r\nwithout success. There was no slit through which a knife could be\r\npassed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but\r\nthey were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. \u201cHum!\u201d\r\nsaid he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, \u201cmy theory certainly\r\npresents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they\r\nwere bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the\r\nmatter.\u201d\r\n\r\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the\r\nthree bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so\r\nwe passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now\r\nsleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a\r\nhomely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after\r\nthe fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in\r\none corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a\r\ndressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles,\r\nwith two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the\r\nroom save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round\r\nand the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old\r\nand discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of\r\nthe house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,\r\nwhile his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in\r\nevery detail of the apartment.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere does that bell communicate with?\u201d he asked at last pointing to a\r\nthick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually\r\nlying upon the pillow.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt goes to the housekeeper\u2019s room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks newer than the other things?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour sister asked for it, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we\r\nwanted for ourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You\r\nwill excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this\r\nfloor.\u201d He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand\r\nand crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks\r\nbetween the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which\r\nthe chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent\r\nsome time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.\r\nFinally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s a dummy,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t it ring?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You\r\ncan see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little\r\nopening for the ventilator is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow very absurd! I never noticed that before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery strange!\u201d muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. \u201cThere are one or\r\ntwo very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a\r\nbuilder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the\r\nsame trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is also quite modern,\u201d said the lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cDone about the same time as the bell-rope?\u201d remarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey seem to have been of a most interesting character\u2014dummy\r\nbell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your\r\npermission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the\r\ninner apartment.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Grimesby Roylott\u2019s chamber was larger than that of his\r\nstep-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden\r\nshelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair\r\nbeside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,\r\nand a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.\r\nHolmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the\r\nkeenest interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d he asked, tapping the safe.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy stepfather\u2019s business papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! you have seen inside, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a cat in it, for example?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. What a strange idea!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, look at this!\u201d He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on\r\nthe top of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; we don\u2019t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a\r\nsaucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay.\r\nThere is one point which I should wish to determine.\u201d He squatted down\r\nin front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the\r\ngreatest attention.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. That is quite settled,\u201d said he, rising and putting his\r\nlens in his pocket. \u201cHullo! Here is something interesting!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one\r\ncorner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied\r\nso as to make a loop of whipcord.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you make of that, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a common enough lash. But I don\u2019t know why it should be tied.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it\u2019s a wicked world, and\r\nwhen a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I\r\nthink that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your\r\npermission we shall walk out upon the lawn.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had never seen my friend\u2019s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was\r\nwhen we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked\r\nseveral times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself\r\nliking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his\r\nreverie.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very essential, Miss Stoner,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you should\r\nabsolutely follow my advice in every respect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall most certainly do so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend\r\nupon your compliance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI assure you that I am in your hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your\r\nroom.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village\r\ninn over there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that is the Crown.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good. Your windows would be visible from there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,\r\nwhen your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the\r\nnight, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put\r\nyour lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with\r\neverything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to\r\noccupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage\r\nthere for one night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, easily.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe rest you will leave in our hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what will you do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the\r\ncause of this noise which has disturbed you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,\u201d said\r\nMiss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion\u2019s sleeve.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, for pity\u2019s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister\u2019s\r\ndeath.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she\r\ndied from some sudden fright.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more\r\ntangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr.\r\nRoylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and\r\nbe brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured\r\nthat we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and\r\nsitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from\r\nour window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the\r\ninhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby\r\nRoylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure\r\nof the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing\r\nthe heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor\u2019s\r\nvoice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.\r\nThe trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring\r\nup among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know, Watson,\u201d said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering\r\ndarkness, \u201cI have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There\r\nis a distinct element of danger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan I be of assistance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour presence might be invaluable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall certainly come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very kind of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than\r\nwas visible to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that\r\nyou saw all that I did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that\r\ncould answer I confess is more than I can imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou saw the ventilator, too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a\r\nsmall opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could\r\nhardly pass through.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke\r\nMoran.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister\r\ncould smell Dr. Roylott\u2019s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once\r\nthat there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only\r\nbe a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner\u2019s\r\ninquiry. I deduced a ventilator.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what harm can there be in that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator\r\nis made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does\r\nnot that strike you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot as yet see any connection.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that\r\nbefore?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot say that I have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same\r\nrelative position to the ventilator and to the rope\u2014or so we may call\r\nit, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I cried, \u201cI seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are\r\nonly just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSubtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is\r\nthe first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and\r\nPritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes\r\neven deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike\r\ndeeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is\r\nover; for goodness\u2019 sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds\r\nfor a few hours to something more cheerful.\u201d\r\n\r\nAbout nine o\u2019clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all\r\nwas dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly\r\naway, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright\r\nlight shone out right in front of us.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is our signal,\u201d said Holmes, springing to his feet; \u201cit comes\r\nfrom the middle window.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining\r\nthat we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was\r\npossible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were\r\nout on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow\r\nlight twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our\r\nsombre errand.\r\n\r\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired\r\nbreaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we\r\nreached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the\r\nwindow when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed\r\nto be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass\r\nwith writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d I whispered; \u201cdid you see it?\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice\r\nupon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put\r\nhis lips to my ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a nice household,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThat is the baboon.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a\r\ncheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any\r\nmoment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following\r\nHolmes\u2019 example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the\r\nbedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp\r\nonto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had\r\nseen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of\r\nhis hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that\r\nI could do to distinguish the words:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe least sound would be fatal to our plans.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded again.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol\r\nready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and\r\nyou in that chair.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\r\n\r\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed\r\nbeside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.\r\nThen he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\r\n\r\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,\r\nnot even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat\r\nopen-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous\r\ntension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of\r\nlight, and we waited in absolute darkness.\r\n\r\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our\r\nvery window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah\r\nwas indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the\r\nparish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they\r\nseemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and\r\nstill we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction\r\nof the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a\r\nstrong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room\r\nhad lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then\r\nall was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an\r\nhour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became\r\naudible\u2014a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of\r\nsteam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,\r\nHolmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with\r\nhis cane at the bell-pull.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see it, Watson?\u201d he yelled. \u201cYou see it?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a\r\nlow, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes\r\nmade it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed\r\nso savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and\r\nfilled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing\r\nup at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the\r\nnight the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled\r\nup louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all\r\nmingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the\r\nvillage, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the\r\nsleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood\r\ngazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died\r\naway into the silence from which it rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can it mean?\u201d I gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt means that it is all over,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cAnd perhaps, after\r\nall, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.\r\nRoylott\u2019s room.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.\r\nTwice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then\r\nhe turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked\r\npistol in my hand.\r\n\r\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a\r\ndark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of\r\nlight upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this\r\ntable, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long\r\ngrey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet\r\nthrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short\r\nstock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin\r\nwas cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at\r\nthe corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow\r\nband, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round\r\nhis head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe band! the speckled band!\u201d whispered Holmes.\r\n\r\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to\r\nmove, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat\r\ndiamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a swamp adder!\u201d cried Holmes; \u201cthe deadliest snake in India. He\r\nhas died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,\r\nrecoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he\r\ndigs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we\r\ncan then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county\r\npolice know what has happened.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man\u2019s lap, and\r\nthrowing the noose round the reptile\u2019s neck he drew it from its horrid\r\nperch and, carrying it at arm\u2019s length, threw it into the iron safe,\r\nwhich he closed upon it.\r\n\r\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke\r\nMoran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has\r\nalready run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news\r\nto the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the\r\ncare of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official\r\ninquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while\r\nindiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet\r\nto learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled\r\nback next day.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had,\u201d said he, \u201ccome to an entirely erroneous conclusion which\r\nshows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\r\ninsufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word\r\n\u2018band,\u2019 which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the\r\nappearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of\r\nher match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I\r\ncan only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position\r\nwhen, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an\r\noccupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.\r\nMy attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to\r\nthis ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The\r\ndiscovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the\r\nfloor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as\r\na bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.\r\nThe idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it\r\nwith my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of\r\ncreatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track.\r\nThe idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be\r\ndiscovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a\r\nclever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity\r\nwith which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point\r\nof view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who\r\ncould distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where\r\nthe poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of\r\ncourse he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to\r\nthe victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we\r\nsaw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this\r\nventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it\r\nwould crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not\r\nbite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but\r\nsooner or later she must fall a victim.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An\r\ninspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of\r\nstanding on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he\r\nshould reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,\r\nand the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which\r\nmay have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was\r\nobviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe\r\nupon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the\r\nsteps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the\r\ncreature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit\r\nthe light and attacked it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith the result of driving it through the ventilator.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the\r\nother side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its\r\nsnakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this\r\nway I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott\u2019s\r\ndeath, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my\r\nconscience.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER\u2019S THUMB\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.\r\nSherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there\r\nwere only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice\u2014that\r\nof Mr. Hatherley\u2019s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton\u2019s madness. Of\r\nthese the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and\r\noriginal observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so\r\ndramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed\r\nupon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those\r\ndeductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable\r\nresults. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the\r\nnewspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less\r\nstriking when set forth _en bloc_ in a single half-column of print than\r\nwhen the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery\r\nclears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which\r\nleads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a\r\ndeep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served\r\nto weaken the effect.\r\n\r\nIt was in the summer of \u201989, not long after my marriage, that the\r\nevents occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to\r\ncivil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street\r\nrooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even\r\npersuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit\r\nus. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no\r\nvery great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from\r\namong the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and\r\nlingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of\r\nendeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nOne morning, at a little before seven o\u2019clock, I was awakened by the\r\nmaid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from\r\nPaddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed\r\nhurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom\r\ntrivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the\r\nguard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got him here,\u201d he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder;\r\n\u201che\u2019s all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some\r\nstrange creature which he had caged up in my room.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new patient,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI thought I\u2019d bring him round\r\nmyself; then he couldn\u2019t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I\r\nmust go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.\u201d And off\r\nhe went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.\r\n\r\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table.\r\nHe was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap\r\nwhich he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a\r\nhandkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He\r\nwas young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong,\r\nmasculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression\r\nof a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took\r\nall his strength of mind to control.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I have had\r\na very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this\r\nmorning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a\r\ndoctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a\r\ncard, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took it up and glanced at it. \u201cMr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic\r\nengineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).\u201d That was the name, style,\r\nand abode of my morning visitor. \u201cI regret that I have kept you\r\nwaiting,\u201d said I, sitting down in my library-chair. \u201cYou are fresh from\r\na night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous\r\noccupation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my night could not be called monotonous,\u201d said he, and laughed. He\r\nlaughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his\r\nchair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against\r\nthat laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop it!\u201d I cried; \u201cpull yourself together!\u201d and I poured out some\r\nwater from a caraffe.\r\n\r\nIt was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical\r\noutbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is\r\nover and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and\r\npale-looking.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been making a fool of myself,\u201d he gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. Drink this.\u201d I dashed some brandy into the water, and the\r\ncolour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better!\u201d said he. \u201cAnd now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly\r\nattend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my\r\nhardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding\r\nfingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have\r\nbeen. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried, \u201cthis is a terrible injury. It must have bled\r\nconsiderably.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have\r\nbeen senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was\r\nstill bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round\r\nthe wrist and braced it up with a twig.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent! You should have been a surgeon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own\r\nprovince.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis has been done,\u201d said I, examining the wound, \u201cby a very heavy and\r\nsharp instrument.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA thing like a cleaver,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn accident, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! a murderous attack?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery murderous indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou horrify me.\u201d\r\n\r\nI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it\r\nover with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without\r\nwincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is that?\u201d I asked when I had finished.\r\n\r\n\u201cCapital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was\r\nvery weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying\r\nto your nerves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,\r\nbetween ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this\r\nwound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for\r\nit is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof\r\nwith which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which\r\nI can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will\r\nbe done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d cried I, \u201cif it is anything in the nature of a problem which you\r\ndesire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my\r\nfriend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I have heard of that fellow,\u201d answered my visitor, \u201cand I should\r\nbe very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must\r\nuse the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to\r\nhim?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do better. I\u2019ll take you round to him myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should be immensely obliged to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a\r\nlittle breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an\r\ninstant.\u201d I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife,\r\nand in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new\r\nacquaintance to Baker Street.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in\r\nhis dressing-gown, reading the agony column of _The Times_ and smoking\r\nhis before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and\r\ndottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and\r\ncollected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his\r\nquietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us\r\nin a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance\r\nupon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of\r\nbrandy and water within his reach.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.\r\nHatherley,\u201d said he. \u201cPray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely\r\nat home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up\r\nyour strength with a little stimulant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said my patient, \u201cbut I have felt another man since the\r\ndoctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the\r\ncure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I\r\nshall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression\r\nwhich veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him,\r\nand we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor\r\ndetailed to us.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must know,\u201d said he, \u201cthat I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing\r\nalone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer,\r\nand I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven\r\nyears that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm,\r\nof Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also\r\ncome into a fair sum of money through my poor father\u2019s death, I\r\ndetermined to start in business for myself and took professional\r\nchambers in Victoria Street.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business\r\na dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two\r\nyears I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is\r\nabsolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings\r\namount to \u00a3 27 10_s_. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in\r\nthe afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began\r\nto sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\u201cYesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my\r\nclerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me\r\nupon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of \u2018Colonel\r\nLysander Stark\u2019 engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel\r\nhimself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding\r\nthinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole\r\nface sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was\r\ndrawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation\r\nseemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was\r\nbright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but\r\nneatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than\r\nthirty.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Mr. Hatherley?\u2019 said he, with something of a German accent. \u2018You have\r\nbeen recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only\r\nproficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of\r\npreserving a secret.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an\r\naddress. \u2018May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at\r\nthis moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan\r\nand a bachelor and are residing alone in London.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That is quite correct,\u2019 I answered; \u2018but you will excuse me if I say\r\nthat I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional\r\nqualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that\r\nyou wished to speak to me?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the\r\npoint. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy\r\nis quite essential\u2014absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we\r\nmay expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in\r\nthe bosom of his family.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018If I promise to keep a secret,\u2019 said I, \u2018you may absolutely depend\r\nupon my doing so.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had\r\nnever seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Do you promise, then?\u2019 said he at last.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, I promise.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference\r\nto the matter at all, either in word or writing?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I have already given you my word.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very good.\u2019 He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across\r\nthe room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That\u2019s all right,\u2019 said he, coming back. \u2018I know that clerks are\r\nsometimes curious as to their master\u2019s affairs. Now we can talk in\r\nsafety.\u2019 He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at\r\nme again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\r\n\r\n\u201cA feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to\r\nrise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my\r\ndread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I beg that you will state your business, sir,\u2019 said I; \u2018my time is of\r\nvalue.\u2019 Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to\r\nmy lips.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018How would fifty guineas for a night\u2019s work suit you?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Most admirably.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I say a night\u2019s work, but an hour\u2019s would be nearer the mark. I\r\nsimply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has\r\ngot out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it\r\nright ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where to?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of\r\nOxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from\r\nPaddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very good.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018There is a drive, then?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven\r\nmiles from Eyford Station.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would\r\nbe no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense\r\nyou for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and\r\nunknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of\r\nyour profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the\r\nbusiness, there is plenty of time to do so.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be\r\nto me. \u2018Not at all,\u2019 said I, \u2018I shall be very happy to accommodate\r\nmyself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little\r\nmore clearly what it is that you wish me to do.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have\r\nexacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to\r\ncommit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I\r\nsuppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Entirely.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that\r\nfuller\u2019s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one\r\nor two places in England?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I have heard so.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Some little time ago I bought a small place\u2014a very small place\u2014within\r\nten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was\r\na deposit of fuller\u2019s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it,\r\nhowever, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and\r\nthat it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right\r\nand left\u2014both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These\r\ngood people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that\r\nwhich was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my\r\ninterest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but\r\nunfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few\r\nof my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we\r\nshould quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in\r\nthis way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the\r\nneighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in\r\norder to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This\r\npress, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish\r\nyour advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously,\r\nhowever, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers\r\ncoming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if\r\nthe facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these\r\nfields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise\r\nme that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford\r\nto-night. I hope that I make it all plain?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I quite follow you,\u2019 said I. \u2018The only point which I could not quite\r\nunderstand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in\r\nexcavating fuller\u2019s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like\r\ngravel from a pit.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah!\u2019 said he carelessly, \u2018we have our own process. We compress the\r\nearth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they\r\nare. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my\r\nconfidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.\u2019\r\nHe rose as he spoke. \u2018I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I shall certainly be there.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And not a word to a soul.\u2019 He looked at me with a last long,\r\nquestioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he\r\nhurried from the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much\r\nastonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had\r\nbeen intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the\r\nfee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price\r\nupon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to\r\nother ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had\r\nmade an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his\r\nexplanation of the fuller\u2019s-earth was sufficient to explain the\r\nnecessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I\r\nshould tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the\r\nwinds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off,\r\nhaving obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.\r\nHowever, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the\r\nlittle dim-lit station after eleven o\u2019clock. I was the only passenger\r\nwho got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single\r\nsleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate,\r\nhowever, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow\r\nupon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me\r\ninto a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the\r\nwindows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as\r\nfast as the horse could go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne horse?\u201d interjected Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, only one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you observe the colour?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the\r\ncarriage. It was a chestnut.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTired-looking or fresh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, fresh and glossy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most\r\ninteresting statement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAway we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander\r\nStark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from\r\nthe rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it\r\nmust have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the\r\ntime, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction,\r\nthat he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem\r\nto be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and\r\njolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of\r\nwhere we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make\r\nout nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and\r\nthen I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but\r\nthe colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon\r\nflagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for\r\nthe crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a\r\nstand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him,\r\npulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped,\r\nas it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I\r\nfailed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The\r\ninstant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily\r\nbehind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage\r\ndrove away.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about\r\nlooking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door\r\nopened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light\r\nshot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a\r\nlamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face\r\nforward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from\r\nthe gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it\r\nwas a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a\r\ntone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a\r\ngruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from\r\nher hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,\r\nand then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he\r\nwalked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few\r\nminutes,\u2019 said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little,\r\nplainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which\r\nseveral German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp\r\non the top of a harmonium beside the door. \u2018I shall not keep you\r\nwaiting an instant,\u2019 said he, and vanished into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201cI glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of\r\nGerman I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the\r\nothers being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window,\r\nhoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak\r\nshutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully\r\nsilent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the\r\npassage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of\r\nuneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and\r\nwhat were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And\r\nwhere was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I\r\nknew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that\r\nmatter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that\r\nradius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was\r\nquite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the\r\ncountry. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath\r\nto keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my\r\nfifty-guinea fee.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter\r\nstillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was\r\nstanding in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the\r\nyellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I\r\ncould see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a\r\nchill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be\r\nsilent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her\r\neyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom\r\nbehind her.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I would go,\u2019 said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak\r\ncalmly; \u2018I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you\r\nto do.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But, madam,\u2019 said I, \u2018I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot\r\npossibly leave until I have seen the machine.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is not worth your while to wait,\u2019 she went on. \u2018You can pass\r\nthrough the door; no one hinders.\u2019 And then, seeing that I smiled and\r\nshook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step\r\nforward, with her hands wrung together. \u2018For the love of Heaven!\u2019 she\r\nwhispered, \u2018get away from here before it is too late!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage\r\nin an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my\r\nfifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night\r\nwhich seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should\r\nI slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the\r\npayment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a\r\nmonomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had\r\nshaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and\r\ndeclared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew\r\nher entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several\r\nfootsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw\r\nup her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as\r\nnoiselessly as she had come.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a\r\nchinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was\r\nintroduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018This is my secretary and manager,\u2019 said the colonel. \u2018By the way, I\r\nwas under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear\r\nthat you have felt the draught.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018On the contrary,\u2019 said I, \u2018I opened the door myself because I felt\r\nthe room to be a little close.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe shot one of his suspicious looks at me. \u2018Perhaps we had better\r\nproceed to business, then,\u2019 said he. \u2018Mr. Ferguson and I will take you\r\nup to see the machine.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I had better put my hat on, I suppose.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, no, it is in the house.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What, you dig fuller\u2019s-earth in the house?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All\r\nwe wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is\r\nwrong with it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWe went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat\r\nmanager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with\r\ncorridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors,\r\nthe thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had\r\ncrossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above\r\nthe ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the\r\ndamp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put\r\non as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the\r\nwarnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen\r\neye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent\r\nman, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least\r\na fellow-countryman.\r\n\r\n\u201cColonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he\r\nunlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us\r\ncould hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the\r\ncolonel ushered me in.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018We are now,\u2019 said he, \u2018actually within the hydraulic press, and it\r\nwould be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn\r\nit on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the\r\ndescending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon\r\nthis metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside\r\nwhich receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the\r\nmanner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but\r\nthere is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little\r\nof its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to\r\nshow us how we can set it right.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.\r\nIt was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous\r\npressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers\r\nwhich controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there\r\nwas a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through\r\none of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the\r\nindia-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk\r\nso as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was\r\nclearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my\r\ncompanions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several\r\npractical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When\r\nI had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the\r\nmachine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was\r\nobvious at a glance that the story of the fuller\u2019s-earth was the merest\r\nfabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an\r\nengine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of\r\nwood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came\r\nto examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I\r\nhad stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I\r\nheard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of\r\nthe colonel looking down at me.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What are you doing there?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that\r\nwhich he had told me. \u2018I was admiring your fuller\u2019s-earth,\u2019 said I; \u2018I\r\nthink that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if\r\nI knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my\r\nspeech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very well,\u2019 said he, \u2018you shall know all about the machine.\u2019 He took\r\na step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the\r\nlock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite\r\nsecure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. \u2018Hullo!\u2019\r\nI yelled. \u2018Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart\r\ninto my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the\r\nleaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood\r\nupon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its\r\nlight I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,\r\njerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must\r\nwithin a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself,\r\nscreaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I\r\nimplored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the\r\nlevers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my\r\nhead, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.\r\nThen it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend\r\nvery much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the\r\nweight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that\r\ndreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve\r\nto lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?\r\nAlready I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which\r\nbrought a gush of hope back to my heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls\r\nwere of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line\r\nof yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and\r\nbroadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could\r\nhardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.\r\nThe next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the\r\nother side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the\r\nlamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal,\r\ntold me how narrow had been my escape.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I\r\nfound myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a\r\nwoman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held\r\na candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had\r\nso foolishly rejected.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Come! come!\u2019 she cried breathlessly. \u2018They will be here in a moment.\r\nThey will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious\r\ntime, but come!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThis time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my\r\nfeet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The\r\nlatter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard\r\nthe sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering\r\nthe other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath. My\r\nguide stopped and looked about her like one  who is at her wit\u2019s end.\r\nThen she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window\r\nof which the moon was shining brightly.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is your only chance,\u2019 said she. \u2018It is high, but it may be that\r\nyou can jump it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAs she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the\r\npassage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing\r\nforward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher\u2019s\r\ncleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the\r\nwindow, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden\r\nlooked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet\r\ndown. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I\r\nshould have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who\r\npursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to\r\ngo back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my\r\nmind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw\r\nher arms round him and tried to hold him back.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Fritz! Fritz!\u2019 she cried in English, \u2018remember your promise after the\r\nlast time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he\r\nwill be silent!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You are mad, Elise!\u2019 he shouted, struggling to break away from her.\r\n\u2018You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!\u2019\r\nHe dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with\r\nhis heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to\r\nthe sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip\r\nloosened, and I fell into the garden below.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and\r\nrushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood\r\nthat I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I\r\nran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my\r\nhand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw\r\nthat my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my\r\nwound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a\r\nsudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among\r\nthe rose-bushes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a\r\nvery long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was\r\nbreaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew,\r\nand my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The\r\nsmarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night\u2019s\r\nadventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly\r\nyet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to\r\nlook round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been\r\nlying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road, and just a little\r\nlower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it,\r\nto be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night.\r\nWere it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during\r\nthose dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\r\n\r\n\u201cHalf dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.\r\nThere would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was\r\non duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him\r\nwhether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was\r\nstrange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for\r\nme? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was\r\none about three miles off.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to\r\nwait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It\r\nwas a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound\r\ndressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I\r\nput the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this\r\nextraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the\r\nshelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his\r\ncuttings.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is an advertisement which will interest you,\u201d said he. \u201cIt\r\nappeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: \u2018Lost, on\r\nthe 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic\r\nengineer. Left his lodgings at ten o\u2019clock at night, and has not been\r\nheard of since. Was dressed in,\u2019 etc., etc. Ha! That represents the\r\nlast time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I\r\nfancy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d cried my patient. \u201cThen that explains what the girl\r\nsaid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUndoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and\r\ndesperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand\r\nin the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will\r\nleave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is\r\nprecious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard\r\nat once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,\r\nbound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock\r\nHolmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard,\r\na plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map\r\nof the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing\r\na circle with Eyford for its centre.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d said he. \u201cThat circle is drawn at a radius of ten\r\nmiles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that\r\nline. You said ten miles, I think, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was an hour\u2019s good drive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you think that they brought you back all that way when you were\r\nunconscious?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been\r\nlifted and conveyed somewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I cannot understand,\u201d said I, \u201cis why they should have spared you\r\nwhen they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain\r\nwas softened by the woman\u2019s entreaties.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my\r\nlife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, we shall soon clear up all that,\u201d said Bradstreet. \u201cWell, I have\r\ndrawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk\r\nthat we are in search of are to be found.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I could lay my finger on it,\u201d said Holmes quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, now!\u201d cried the inspector, \u201cyou have formed your opinion!\r\nCome, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the\r\ncountry is more deserted there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I say east,\u201d said my patient.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am for west,\u201d remarked the plain-clothes man. \u201cThere are several\r\nquiet little villages up there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I am for north,\u201d said I, \u201cbecause there are no hills there, and\r\nour friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d cried the inspector, laughing; \u201cit\u2019s a very pretty diversity of\r\nopinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your\r\ncasting vote to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are all wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t all be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, you can. This is my point.\u201d He placed his finger in the\r\ncentre of the circle. \u201cThis is where we shall find them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the twelve-mile drive?\u201d gasped Hatherley.\r\n\r\n\u201cSix out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse\r\nwas fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had\r\ngone twelve miles over heavy roads?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, it is a likely ruse enough,\u201d observed Bradstreet thoughtfully.\r\n\u201cOf course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone at all,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThey are coiners on a large scale, and\r\nhave used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of\r\nsilver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,\u201d said the\r\ninspector. \u201cThey have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We\r\neven traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they\r\nhad covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old\r\nhands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got\r\nthem right enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined\r\nto fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we\r\nsaw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small\r\nclump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich\r\nfeather over the landscape.\r\n\r\n\u201cA house on fire?\u201d asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on\r\nits way.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d said the station-master.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did it break out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and\r\nthe whole place is in a blaze.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhose house is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Becher\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me,\u201d broke in the engineer, \u201cis Dr. Becher a German, very thin,\r\nwith a long, sharp nose?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe station-master laughed heartily. \u201cNo, sir, Dr. Becher is an\r\nEnglishman, and there isn\u2019t a man in the parish who has a better-lined\r\nwaistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I\r\nunderstand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good\r\nBerkshire beef would do him no harm.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all\r\nhastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and\r\nthere was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us,\r\nspouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front\r\nthree fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. \u201cThere is the\r\ngravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second\r\nwindow is the one that I jumped from.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, at least,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cyou have had your revenge upon them.\r\nThere can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was\r\ncrushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt\r\nthey were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.\r\nNow keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night,\r\nthough I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd Holmes\u2019 fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no\r\nword has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister\r\nGerman, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met\r\na cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving\r\nrapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the\r\nfugitives disappeared, and even Holmes\u2019 ingenuity failed ever to\r\ndiscover the least clue as to their whereabouts.\r\n\r\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which\r\nthey had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed\r\nhuman thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset,\r\nhowever, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the\r\nflames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been\r\nreduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and\r\niron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our\r\nunfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin\r\nwere discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,\r\nwhich may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have\r\nbeen already referred to.\r\n\r\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the\r\nspot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a\r\nmystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain\r\ntale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom\r\nhad remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the\r\nwhole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold\r\nor less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear\r\nthe unconscious man out of the way of danger.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once\r\nmore to London, \u201cit has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my\r\nthumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExperience,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cIndirectly it may be of value,\r\nyou know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of\r\nbeing excellent company for the remainder of your existence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long\r\nceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which\r\nthe unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and\r\ntheir more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this\r\nfour-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the\r\nfull facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my\r\nfriend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter\r\nup, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little\r\nsketch of this remarkable episode.\r\n\r\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was\r\nstill sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from\r\nan afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I\r\nhad remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn\r\nto rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had\r\nbrought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign\r\nthrobbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my\r\nlegs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers\r\nuntil at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all\r\naside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the\r\nenvelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend\u2019s noble\r\ncorrespondent could be.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is a very fashionable epistle,\u201d I remarked as he entered. \u201cYour\r\nmorning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a\r\ntide-waiter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,\u201d he\r\nanswered, smiling, \u201cand the humbler are usually the more interesting.\r\nThis looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon\r\na man either to be bored or to lie.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot social, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, distinctly professional.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd from a noble client?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of the highest in England.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I congratulate you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my\r\nclient is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.\r\nIt is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this\r\nnew investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late,\r\nhave you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks like it,\u201d said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the\r\ncorner. \u201cI have had nothing else to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read\r\nnothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is\r\nalways instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely\r\nyou must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, with the deepest interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St.\r\nSimon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these\r\npapers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    \u201c\u2018MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\u2014Lord Backwater tells me that I may\r\n    place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have\r\n    determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in\r\n    reference to the very painful event which has occurred in\r\n    connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is\r\n    acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no\r\n    objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it\r\n    might be of some assistance. I will call at four o\u2019clock in the\r\n    afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time,\r\n    I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount\r\n    importance. Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n    \u201c\u2018ROBERT ST. SIMON.\u2019\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the\r\nnoble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer\r\nside of his right little finger,\u201d remarked Holmes as he folded up the\r\nepistle.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe says four o\u2019clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the\r\nsubject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order\r\nof time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.\u201d He picked a\r\nred-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the\r\nmantelpiece. \u201cHere he is,\u201d said he, sitting down and flattening it out\r\nupon his knee. \u201c\u2018Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son\r\nof the Duke of Balmoral.\u2019 Hum! \u2018Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief\r\nover a fess sable. Born in 1846.\u2019 He\u2019s forty-one years of age, which is\r\nmature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late\r\nadministration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for\r\nForeign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and\r\nTudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive\r\nin all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more\r\nsolid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have very little difficulty in finding what I want,\u201d said I, \u201cfor\r\nthe facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I\r\nfeared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry\r\non hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.\r\nThat is quite cleared up now\u2014though, indeed, it was obvious from the\r\nfirst. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal\r\ncolumn of the _Morning Post_, and dates, as you see, some weeks back:\r\n\u2018A marriage has been arranged,\u2019 it says, \u2018and will, if rumour is\r\ncorrect, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second\r\nson of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of\r\nAloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.\u2019 That is all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTerse and to the point,\u201d remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin\r\nlegs towards the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of\r\nthe same week. Ah, here it is: \u2018There will soon be a call for\r\nprotection in the marriage  market, for the present free-trade\r\nprinciple appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one\r\nthe management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the\r\nhands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important\r\naddition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes\r\nwhich have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon,\r\nwho has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little\r\ngod\u2019s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage\r\nwith Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California\r\nmillionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face\r\nattracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only\r\nchild, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to\r\nconsiderably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As\r\nit is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to\r\nsell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has\r\nno property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is\r\nobvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an\r\nalliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition\r\nfrom a Republican lady to a British peeress.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d asked Holmes, yawning.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the _Morning Post_ to\r\nsay that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would\r\nbe at St. George\u2019s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate\r\nfriends would be invited, and that the party would return to the\r\nfurnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius\r\nDoran. Two days later\u2014that is, on Wednesday last\u2014there is a curt\r\nannouncement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon\r\nwould be passed at Lord Backwater\u2019s place, near Petersfield. Those are\r\nall the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore the what?\u201d asked Holmes with a start.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe vanishing of the lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did she vanish, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the wedding breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite\r\ndramatic, in fact.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the\r\nhoneymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.\r\nPray let me have the details.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI warn you that they are very incomplete.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps we may make them less so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning\r\npaper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, \u2018Singular\r\nOccurrence at a Fashionable Wedding\u2019:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest\r\nconsternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken\r\nplace in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly\r\nannounced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning;\r\nbut it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange\r\nrumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the\r\nattempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention\r\nhas now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by\r\naffecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The ceremony, which was performed at St. George\u2019s, Hanover Square,\r\nwas a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the\r\nbride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater,\r\nLord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister\r\nof the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party\r\nproceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster\r\nGate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little\r\ntrouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who\r\nendeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party,\r\nalleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after\r\na painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and\r\nthe footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before\r\nthis unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,\r\nwhen she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room.\r\nHer prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed\r\nher, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber\r\nfor an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the\r\npassage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the\r\nhouse thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his\r\nmistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that\r\nhis daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with\r\nthe bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the\r\npolice, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will\r\nprobably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business.\r\nUp to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the\r\nwhereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the\r\nmatter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the\r\nwoman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from\r\njealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the\r\nstrange disappearance of the bride.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd is that all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a\r\nsuggestive one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it is\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has\r\nactually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_\r\nat the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.\r\nThere are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands\r\nnow\u2014so far as it has been set forth in the public press.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have\r\nmissed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as\r\nthe clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this\r\nwill prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I\r\nvery much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own\r\nmemory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLord Robert St. Simon,\u201d announced our page-boy, throwing open the\r\ndoor. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed\r\nand pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with\r\nthe steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever\r\nbeen to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his\r\ngeneral appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight\r\nforward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair,\r\ntoo, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the\r\nedges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the\r\nverge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white\r\nwaistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured\r\ngaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left\r\nto right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden\r\neyeglasses.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-day, Lord St. Simon,\u201d said Holmes, rising and bowing. \u201cPray take\r\nthe basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up\r\na little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr.\r\nHolmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have\r\nalready managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I\r\npresume that they were hardly from the same class of society.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I am descending.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg pardon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy last client of the sort was a king.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, really! I had no idea. And which king?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe King of Scandinavia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! Had he lost his wife?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can understand,\u201d said Holmes suavely, \u201cthat I extend to the\r\naffairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in\r\nyours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course! Very right! very right! I\u2019m sure I beg pardon. As to my own\r\ncase, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in\r\nforming an opinion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,\r\nnothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct\u2014this article, for\r\nexample, as to the disappearance of the bride.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. \u201cYes, it is correct, as far as it\r\ngoes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer\r\nan opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by\r\nquestioning you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn San Francisco, a year ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were travelling in the States?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you become engaged then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you were on a friendly footing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHer father is very rich?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did he make his money?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,\r\ninvested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, what is your own impression as to the young lady\u2019s\u2014your wife\u2019s\r\ncharacter?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the\r\nfire. \u201cYou see, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said he, \u201cmy wife was twenty before her\r\nfather became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining\r\ncamp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has\r\ncome from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call\r\nin England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by\r\nany sort of traditions. She is impetuous\u2014volcanic, I was about to say.\r\nShe is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her\r\nresolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name\r\nwhich I have the honour to bear\u201d\u2014he gave a little stately cough\u2014\u201chad I\r\nnot thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is\r\ncapable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would\r\nbe repugnant to her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you her photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI brought this with me.\u201d He opened a locket and showed us the full\r\nface of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory\r\nminiature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the\r\nlustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.\r\nHolmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and\r\nhanded it back to Lord St. Simon.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your\r\nacquaintance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met\r\nher several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait\r\naccompli_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI really have made no inquiries on the subject.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the\r\nwedding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas she in good spirits?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future\r\nlives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was as bright as possible\u2014at least until after the ceremony.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd did you observe any change in her then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever\r\nseen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was\r\ntoo trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray let us have it, for all that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the\r\nvestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over\r\ninto the pew. There was a moment\u2019s delay, but the gentleman in the pew\r\nhanded it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for\r\nthe fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me\r\nabruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly\r\nagitated over this trifling cause.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the\r\ngeneral public were present, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis gentleman was not one of your wife\u2019s friends?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a\r\ncommon-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I\r\nthink that we are wandering rather far from the point.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful\r\nframe of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering\r\nher father\u2019s house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw her in conversation with her maid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who is her maid?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlice is her name. She is an American and came from California with\r\nher.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA confidential servant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to\r\ntake great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these\r\nthings in a different way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long did she speak to this Alice?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did not overhear what they said?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLady St. Simon said something about \u2018jumping a claim.\u2019 She was\r\naccustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAmerican slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do\r\nwhen she finished speaking to her maid?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe walked into the breakfast-room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn your arm?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then,\r\nafter we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly,\r\nmuttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came\r\nback.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her\r\nroom, covered her bride\u2019s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet,\r\nand went out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in\r\ncompany with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had\r\nalready made a disturbance at Mr. Doran\u2019s house that morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and\r\nyour relations to her.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. \u201cWe have\r\nbeen on a friendly footing for some years\u2014I may say on a _very_\r\nfriendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her\r\nungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but\r\nyou know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but\r\nexceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me\r\ndreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to\r\ntell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly\r\nwas that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came\r\nto Mr. Doran\u2019s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push\r\nher way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even\r\nthreatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the\r\nsort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon\r\npushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good\r\nin making a row.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid your wife hear all this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, thank goodness, she did not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so\r\nserious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some\r\nterrible trap for her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is a possible supposition.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think so, too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this\r\nas likely?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not think Flora would hurt a fly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is\r\nyour own theory as to what took place?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have\r\ngiven you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it\r\nhas occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the\r\nconsciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the\r\neffect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn short, that she had become suddenly deranged?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, really, when I consider that she has turned her back\u2014I will not\r\nsay upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without\r\nsuccess\u2014I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,\u201d said Holmes,\r\nsmiling. \u201cAnd now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my\r\ndata. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that\r\nyou could see out of the window?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe could see the other side of the road and the Park.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I\r\nshall communicate with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShould you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,\u201d said our\r\nclient, rising.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have solved it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEh? What was that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say that I have solved it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere, then, is my wife?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a detail which I shall speedily supply.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon shook his head. \u201cI am afraid that it will take wiser\r\nheads than yours or mine,\u201d he remarked, and bowing in a stately,\r\nold-fashioned manner he departed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a\r\nlevel with his own,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \u201cI think that I\r\nshall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this\r\ncross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before\r\nour client came into the room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked\r\nbefore, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn\r\nmy conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally\r\nvery convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote\r\nThoreau\u2019s example.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I have heard all that you have heard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me\r\nso well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and\r\nsomething on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the\r\nFranco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases\u2014but, hullo, here is\r\nLestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon\r\nthe sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which\r\ngave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas\r\nbag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the\r\ncigar which had been offered to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, then?\u201d asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. \u201cYou look\r\ndissatisfied.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case.\r\nI can make neither head nor tail of the business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally! You surprise me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip\r\nthrough my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd very wet it seems to have made you,\u201d said Holmes laying his hand\r\nupon the arm of the pea-jacket.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn Heaven\u2019s name, what for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn search of the body of Lady St. Simon.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy? What do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one\r\nas in the other.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. \u201cI suppose you know all\r\nabout it,\u201d he snarled.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the\r\nmatter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it very unlikely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in\r\nit?\u201d He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a\r\nwedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a\r\nbride\u2019s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. \u201cThere,\u201d\r\nsaid he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. \u201cThere is\r\na little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed!\u201d said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. \u201cYou\r\ndragged them from the Serpentine?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They\r\nhave been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the\r\nclothes were there the body would not be far off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the same brilliant reasoning, every man\u2019s body is to be found in\r\nthe neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive\r\nat through this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid that you will find it difficult.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you, indeed, now?\u201d cried Lestrade with some bitterness. \u201cI am\r\nafraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions\r\nand your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes.\r\nThis dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the\r\ncard-case is a note. And here is the very note.\u201d He slapped it down\r\nupon the table in front of him. \u201cListen to this: \u2018You will see me when\r\nall is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.\u2019 Now my theory all along has been\r\nthat Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she,\r\nwith confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.\r\nHere, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt\r\nquietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within\r\ntheir reach.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good, Lestrade,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cYou really are very fine\r\nindeed. Let me see it.\u201d He took up the paper in a listless way, but his\r\nattention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of\r\nsatisfaction. \u201cThis is indeed important,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! you find it so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExtremely so. I congratulate you warmly.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. \u201cWhy,\u201d he\r\nshrieked, \u201cyou\u2019re looking at the wrong side!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, this is the right side.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe right side? You\u2019re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over\r\nhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill,\r\nwhich interests me deeply.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in it. I looked at it before,\u201d said Lestrade. \u201c\u2018Oct.\r\n4th, rooms 8_s_., breakfast 2_s_. 6_d_., cocktail 1_s_., lunch 2_s_.\r\n6_d_., glass sherry, 8_d_.\u2019 I see nothing in that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note,\r\nit is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate\r\nyou again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve wasted time enough,\u201d said Lestrade, rising. \u201cI believe in hard\r\nwork and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day,\r\nMr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter\r\nfirst.\u201d He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made\r\nfor the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust one hint to you, Lestrade,\u201d drawled Holmes before his rival\r\nvanished; \u201cI will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St.\r\nSimon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such\r\nperson.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his\r\nforehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his\r\novercoat. \u201cThere is something in what the fellow says about outdoor\r\nwork,\u201d he remarked, \u201cso I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your\r\npapers for a little.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was after five o\u2019clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no\r\ntime to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner\u2019s\r\nman with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a\r\nyouth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great\r\nastonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out\r\nupon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of\r\ncold woodcock, a pheasant, a _p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras_ pie with a group of\r\nancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my\r\ntwo visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with\r\nno explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered\r\nto this address.\r\n\r\nJust before nine o\u2019clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.\r\nHis features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which\r\nmade me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have laid the supper, then,\u201d he said, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to expect company. They have laid for five.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,\u201d said he. \u201cI am\r\nsurprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that\r\nI hear his step now upon the stairs.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,\r\ndangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very\r\nperturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy messenger reached you, then?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have\r\nyou good authority for what you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe best possible.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat will the Duke say,\u201d he murmured, \u201cwhen he hears that one of the\r\nfamily has been subjected to such humiliation?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any\r\nhumiliation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, you look on these things from another standpoint.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady\r\ncould have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was\r\nundoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise\r\nher at such a crisis.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a slight, sir, a public slight,\u201d said Lord St. Simon, tapping\r\nhis fingers upon the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented\r\na position.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been\r\nshamefully used.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I heard a ring,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYes, there are steps on\r\nthe landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the\r\nmatter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more\r\nsuccessful.\u201d He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.\r\n\u201cLord St. Simon,\u201d said he \u201callow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs.\r\nFrancis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and\r\nstood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the\r\nbreast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had\r\ntaken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he\r\nstill refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution,\r\nperhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re angry, Robert,\u201d said she. \u201cWell, I guess you have every cause\r\nto be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray make no apology to me,\u201d said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should\r\nhave spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from\r\nthe time when I saw Frank here again I just didn\u2019t know what I was\r\ndoing or saying. I only wonder I didn\u2019t fall down and do a faint right\r\nthere before the altar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the\r\nroom while you explain this matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I may give an opinion,\u201d remarked the strange gentleman, \u201cwe\u2019ve had\r\njust a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part,\r\nI should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.\u201d He was\r\na small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll tell our story right away,\u201d said the lady. \u201cFrank here and I\r\nmet in \u201984, in McQuire\u2019s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a\r\nclaim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day\r\nfather struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had\r\na claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the\r\npoorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn\u2019t hear of our engagement lasting\r\nany longer, and he took me away to \u2019Frisco. Frank wouldn\u2019t throw up his\r\nhand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing\r\nanything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just\r\nfixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his\r\npile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa.\r\nSo then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged\r\nmyself not to marry anyone else while he lived. \u2018Why shouldn\u2019t we be\r\nmarried right away, then,\u2019 said he, \u2018and then I will feel sure of you;\r\nand I won\u2019t claim to be your husband until I come back?\u2019 Well, we\r\ntalked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman\r\nall ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank\r\nwent off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went\r\nprospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After\r\nthat came a long newspaper story about how a miners\u2019 camp had been\r\nattacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank\u2019s name among the\r\nkilled. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa\r\nthought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in \u2019Frisco. Not\r\na word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that\r\nFrank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to \u2019Frisco, and we came\r\nto London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I\r\nfelt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place\r\nin my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I\u2019d have done my\r\nduty by him. We can\u2019t command our love, but we can our actions. I went\r\nto the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a\r\nwife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just\r\nas I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and\r\nlooking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at\r\nfirst; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of\r\nquestion in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to\r\nsee him. I wonder I didn\u2019t drop. I know that everything was turning\r\nround, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee\r\nin my ear. I didn\u2019t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make\r\na scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know\r\nwhat I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to\r\nbe still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that\r\nhe was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped\r\nmy bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he\r\nreturned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when\r\nhe made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment\r\nthat my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever\r\nhe might direct.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and\r\nhad always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a\r\nfew things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to\r\nLord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all\r\nthose great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain\r\nafterwards. I hadn\u2019t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank\r\nout of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and\r\nthen began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and\r\nfollowed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St.\r\nSimon to me\u2014seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little\r\nsecret of his own before marriage also\u2014but I managed to get away from\r\nher and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we\r\ndrove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my\r\ntrue wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a\r\nprisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to \u2019Frisco, found that\r\nI had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there,\r\nand had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw it in a paper,\u201d explained the American. \u201cIt gave the name and\r\nthe church but not where the lady lived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for\r\nopenness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should\r\nlike to vanish away and never see any of them again\u2014just sending a line\r\nto Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to\r\nthink of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table\r\nand waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and\r\nthings and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and\r\ndropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely\r\nthat we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good\r\ngentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he\r\nfound us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and\r\nkindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be\r\nputting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to\r\ngive us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came\r\nright away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it\r\nall, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you\r\ndo not think very meanly of me.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had\r\nlistened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is not my custom to discuss my most\r\nintimate personal affairs in this public manner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t forgive me? You won\u2019t shake hands before I go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.\u201d He put out his hand\r\nand coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had hoped,\u201d suggested Holmes, \u201cthat you would have joined us in a\r\nfriendly supper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that there you ask a little too much,\u201d responded his Lordship.\r\n\u201cI may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can\r\nhardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your\r\npermission I will now wish you all a very good-night.\u201d He included us\r\nall in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,\u201d said\r\nSherlock Holmes. \u201cIt is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton,\r\nfor I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the\r\nblundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our\r\nchildren from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country\r\nunder a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the\r\nStars and Stripes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe case has been an interesting one,\u201d remarked Holmes when our\r\nvisitors had left us, \u201cbecause it serves to show very clearly how\r\nsimple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems\r\nto be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the\r\nsequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than\r\nthe result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland\r\nYard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were not yourself at fault at all, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the\r\nlady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other\r\nthat she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.\r\nObviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her\r\nto change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have\r\nspoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of\r\nthe bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be\r\nsomeone from America because she had spent so short a time in this\r\ncountry that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an\r\ninfluence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to\r\nchange her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a\r\nprocess of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American.\r\nThen who could this American be, and why should he possess so much\r\ninfluence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her\r\nyoung womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under\r\nstrange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St.\r\nSimon\u2019s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in\r\nthe bride\u2019s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as\r\nthe dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and\r\nof her very significant allusion to claim-jumping\u2014which in miners\u2019\r\nparlance means taking possession of that which another person has a\r\nprior claim to\u2014the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had\r\ngone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous\r\nhusband\u2014the chances being in favour of the latter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how in the world did you find them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in\r\nhis hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials\r\nwere, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was\r\nit to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the\r\nmost select London hotels.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you deduce the select?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a\r\nglass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are\r\nnot many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I\r\nvisited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the\r\nbook that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the\r\nday before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon\r\nthe very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were\r\nto be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being\r\nfortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give\r\nthem some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be\r\nbetter in every way that they should make their position a little\r\nclearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular.\r\nI invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the\r\nappointment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut with no very good result,\u201d I remarked. \u201cHis conduct was certainly\r\nnot very gracious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, smiling, \u201cperhaps you would not be very\r\ngracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you\r\nfound yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think\r\nthat we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars\r\nthat we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw\r\nyour chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still\r\nto solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down\r\nthe street, \u201chere is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that\r\nhis relatives should allow him to come out alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the\r\npockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a\r\nbright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still\r\nlay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down\r\nthe centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly\r\nband by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of\r\nthe footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement\r\nhad been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so\r\nthat there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction\r\nof the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman\r\nwhose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a\r\nmassive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed\r\nin a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat\r\nbrown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were\r\nin absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was\r\nrunning hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives\r\nwho is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he\r\njerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face\r\ninto the most extraordinary contortions.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth can be the matter with him?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe is looking up\r\nat the numbers of the houses.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe that he is coming here,\u201d said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think\r\nthat I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?\u201d As he spoke,\r\nthe man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell\r\nuntil the whole house resounded with the clanging.\r\n\r\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still\r\ngesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his\r\neyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For\r\na while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked\r\nat his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his\r\nreason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against\r\nthe wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away\r\nto the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the\r\neasy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with\r\nhim in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have come to me to tell your story, have you not?\u201d said he. \u201cYou\r\nare fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered\r\nyourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little\r\nproblem which you may submit to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against\r\nhis emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his\r\nlips tight, and turned his face towards us.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt you think me mad?\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see that you have had some great trouble,\u201d responded Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod knows I have!\u2014a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so\r\nsudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced,\r\nalthough I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain.\r\nPrivate affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming\r\ntogether, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very\r\nsoul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may\r\nsuffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray compose yourself, sir,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cand let me have a clear\r\naccount of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name,\u201d answered our visitor, \u201cis probably familiar to your ears. I\r\nam Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of\r\nThreadneedle Street.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner\r\nin the second largest private banking concern in the City of London.\r\nWhat could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens\r\nof London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until\r\nwith another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\r\n\r\n\u201cI feel that time is of value,\u201d said he; \u201cthat is why I hastened here\r\nwhen the police inspector suggested that I should secure your\r\nco-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried\r\nfrom there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is\r\nwhy I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little\r\nexercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as\r\nshortly and yet as clearly as I can.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking\r\nbusiness as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative\r\ninvestments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the\r\nnumber of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out\r\nmoney is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We\r\nhave done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and\r\nthere are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon\r\nthe security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\r\n\r\n\u201cYesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card\r\nwas brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the\r\nname, for it was that of none other than\u2014well, perhaps even to you I\r\nhad better say no more than that it was a name which is a household\r\nword all over the earth\u2014one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names\r\nin England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he\r\nentered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air\r\nof a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Mr. Holder,\u2019 said he, \u2018I have been informed that you are in the habit\r\nof advancing money.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The firm does so when the security is good.\u2019 I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is absolutely essential to me,\u2019 said he, \u2018that I should have \u00a3\r\n50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times\r\nover from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business\r\nand to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily\r\nunderstand that it is unwise to place one\u2019s self under obligations.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most\r\ncertainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it\r\nright to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should\r\nbe paid at once.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own\r\nprivate purse,\u2019 said I, \u2018were it not that the strain would be rather\r\nmore than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the\r\nname of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that,\r\neven in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should much prefer to have it so,\u2019 said he, raising up a square,\r\nblack morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. \u2018You have\r\ndoubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Precisely.\u2019 He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,\r\nflesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he\r\nhad named. \u2018There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,\u2019 said he, \u2018and the\r\nprice of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would\r\nput the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am\r\nprepared to leave it with you as my security.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity\r\nfrom it to my illustrious client.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You doubt its value?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Not at all. I only doubt\u2014\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about\r\nthat. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain\r\nthat I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter\r\nof form. Is the security sufficient?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ample.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of\r\nthe confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard\r\nof you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all\r\ngossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with\r\nevery possible precaution because I need not say that a great public\r\nscandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it\r\nwould be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no\r\nberyls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to\r\nreplace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and\r\nI shall call for it in person on Monday morning.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cSeeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,\r\ncalling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty \u00a3 1000 notes.\r\nWhen I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon\r\nthe table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of\r\nthe immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no\r\ndoubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would\r\nensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having\r\never consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter\r\nthe matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once\r\nmore to my work.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so\r\nprecious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers\u2019 safes had been\r\nforced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible\r\nwould be the position in which I should find myself! I determined,\r\ntherefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case\r\nbackward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of\r\nmy reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house\r\nat Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely\r\nuntil I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my\r\ndressing-room.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to\r\nthoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of\r\nthe house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants\r\nwho have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability\r\nis quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid,\r\nhas only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent\r\ncharacter, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very\r\npretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about\r\nthe place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we\r\nbelieve her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will\r\nnot take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son,\r\nArthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes\u2014a grievous\r\ndisappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell\r\nme that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died\r\nI felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile\r\nfade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish.\r\nPerhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner,\r\nbut I meant it for the best.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my\r\nbusiness, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and,\r\nto speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums\r\nof money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club,\r\nand there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a\r\nnumber of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play\r\nheavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again\r\nand again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his\r\nallowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than\r\nonce to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but\r\neach time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough\r\nto draw him back again.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell\r\nshould gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to\r\nmy house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the\r\nfascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world\r\nto his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a\r\nbrilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think\r\nof him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am\r\nconvinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in\r\nhis eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think,\r\nand so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman\u2019s quick insight\r\ninto character.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when\r\nmy brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I\r\nadopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is\r\na sunbeam in my house\u2014sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and\r\nhousekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be.\r\nShe is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In\r\nonly one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has\r\nasked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she\r\nhas refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the\r\nright path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have\r\nchanged his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late\u2014forever too late!\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I\r\nshall continue with my miserable story.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after\r\ndinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious\r\ntreasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my\r\nclient. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left\r\nthe room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur\r\nwere much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I\r\nthought it better not to disturb it.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where have you put it?\u2019 asked Arthur.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018In my own bureau.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, I hope to goodness the house won\u2019t be burgled during the\r\nnight.\u2019 said he.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is locked up,\u2019 I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have\r\nopened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what\r\nhe said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very\r\ngrave face.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Look here, dad,\u2019 said he with his eyes cast down, \u2018can you let me\r\nhave \u00a3 200?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I cannot!\u2019 I answered sharply. \u2018I have been far too generous with\r\nyou in money matters.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You have been very kind,\u2019 said he, \u2018but I must have this money, or\r\nelse I can never show my face inside the club again.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And a very good thing, too!\u2019 I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,\u2019 said he.\r\n\u2018I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and\r\nif you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. \u2018You\r\nshall not have a farthing from me,\u2019 I cried, on which he bowed and left\r\nthe room without another word.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was\r\nsafe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see\r\nthat all was secure\u2014a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I\r\nthought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs\r\nI saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and\r\nfastened as I approached.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tell me, dad,\u2019 said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, \u2018did\r\nyou give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Certainly not.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has\r\nonly been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is\r\nhardly safe and should be stopped.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are\r\nyou sure that everything is fastened?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Quite sure, dad.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then, good-night.\u2019 I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again,\r\nwhere I was soon asleep.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have\r\nany bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any\r\npoint which I do not make clear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be\r\nparticularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my\r\nmind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in\r\nthe morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had\r\nceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as\r\nthough a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all\r\nmy ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of\r\nfootsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all\r\npalpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Arthur!\u2019 I screamed, \u2018you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that\r\ncoronet?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed\r\nonly in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding\r\nthe coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending\r\nit with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and\r\nturned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the\r\ngold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You blackguard!\u2019 I shouted, beside myself with rage. \u2018You have\r\ndestroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels\r\nwhich you have stolen?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Stolen!\u2019 he cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, thief!\u2019 I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,\u2019 said he.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you\r\na liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another\r\npiece?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You have called me names enough,\u2019 said he, \u2018I will not stand it any\r\nlonger. I shall not say another word about this business, since you\r\nhave chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and\r\nmake my own way in the world.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You shall leave it in the hands of the police!\u2019 I cried half-mad with\r\ngrief and rage. \u2018I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You shall learn nothing from me,\u2019 said he with a passion such as I\r\nshould not have thought was in his nature. \u2018If you choose to call the\r\npolice, let the police find what they can.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cBy this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in\r\nmy anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of\r\nthe coronet and of Arthur\u2019s face, she read the whole story and, with a\r\nscream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the\r\npolice and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the\r\ninspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood\r\nsullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to\r\ncharge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private\r\nmatter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was\r\nnational property. I was determined that the law should have its way in\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018At least,\u2019 said he, \u2018you will not have me arrested at once. It would\r\nbe to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for\r\nfive minutes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have\r\nstolen,\u2019 said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I\r\nwas placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that\r\nof one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened\r\nto raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it\r\nall if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing\r\nstones.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You may as well face the matter,\u2019 said I; \u2018you have been caught in\r\nthe act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you\r\nbut make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the\r\nberyls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,\u2019 he answered, turning\r\naway from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words\r\nof mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the\r\ninspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only\r\nof his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where\r\nhe could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could\r\nbe found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our\r\npersuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and\r\nI, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round\r\nto you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The\r\npolice have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of\r\nit. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already\r\noffered a reward of \u00a3 1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my\r\nhonour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro,\r\ndroning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted\r\nand his eyes fixed upon the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you receive much company?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of\r\nArthur\u2019s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one\r\nelse, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you go out much in society?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cArthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is unusual in a young girl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is\r\nfour-and-twenty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her\r\nalso.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTerrible! She is even more affected than I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have neither of you any doubt as to your son\u2019s guilt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in\r\nhis hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the\r\ncoronet at all injured?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it was twisted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten\r\nit?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it\r\nis too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose\r\nwere innocent, why did he not say so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His\r\nsilence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular\r\npoints about the case. What did the police think of the noise which\r\nawoke you from your sleep?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey considered that it might be caused by Arthur\u2019s closing his\r\nbedroom door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as\r\nto wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of\r\nthese gems?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the\r\nhope of finding them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave they thought of looking outside the house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has\r\nalready been minutely examined.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my dear sir,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cis it not obvious to you now that\r\nthis matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the\r\npolice were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a\r\nsimple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is\r\ninvolved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his\r\nbed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau,\r\ntook out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it,\r\nwent off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the\r\nthirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then\r\nreturned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed\r\nhimself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is\r\nsuch a theory tenable?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what other is there?\u201d cried the banker with a gesture of despair.\r\n\u201cIf his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is our task to find that out,\u201d replied Holmes; \u201cso now, if you\r\nplease, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote\r\nan hour to glancing a little more closely into details.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which\r\nI was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply\r\nstirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt\r\nof the banker\u2019s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his\r\nunhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes\u2019 judgment that I\r\nfelt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was\r\ndissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the\r\nwhole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his\r\nbreast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.\r\nOur client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of\r\nhope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a\r\ndesultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway\r\njourney and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence\r\nof the great financier.\r\n\r\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a\r\nlittle from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,\r\nstretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the\r\nentrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into\r\na narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the\r\nkitchen door, and forming the tradesmen\u2019s entrance. On the left ran a\r\nlane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at\r\nall, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us\r\nstanding at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the\r\nfront, down the tradesmen\u2019s path, and so round by the garden behind\r\ninto the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into\r\nthe dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were\r\nsitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.\r\nShe was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,\r\nwhich seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do\r\nnot think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman\u2019s face.\r\nHer lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.\r\nAs she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater\r\nsense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the\r\nmore striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,\r\nwith immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she\r\nwent straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a\r\nsweet womanly caress.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,\r\ndad?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman\u2019s instincts\r\nare. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for\r\nhaving acted so harshly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy is he silent, then, if he is innocent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect\r\nhim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the\r\ncoronet in his hand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my\r\nword for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more.\r\nIt is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall never let it drop until the gems are found\u2014never, Mary! Your\r\naffection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far\r\nfrom hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London\r\nto inquire more deeply into it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis gentleman?\u201d she asked, facing round to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the\r\nstable lane now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe stable lane?\u201d She raised her dark eyebrows. \u201cWhat can he hope to\r\nfind there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will\r\nsucceed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin\r\nArthur is innocent of this crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove\r\nit,\u201d returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his\r\nshoes. \u201cI believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder.\r\nMight I ask you a question or two?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou heard nothing yourself last night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and\r\nI came down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all\r\nthe windows?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere they all fastened this morning?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to\r\nyour uncle last night that she had been out to see him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may\r\nhave heard uncle\u2019s remarks about the coronet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart,\r\nand that the two may have planned the robbery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what is the good of all these vague theories,\u201d cried the banker\r\nimpatiently, \u201cwhen I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet\r\nin his hands?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl,\r\nMiss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met\r\nher slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His\r\nname is Francis Prosper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe stood,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cto the left of the door\u2014that is to say,\r\nfarther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he is a man with a wooden leg?\u201d\r\n\r\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady\u2019s expressive black\r\neyes. \u201cWhy, you are like a magician,\u201d said she. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\r\nShe smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes\u2019 thin, eager\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should be very glad now to go upstairs,\u201d said he. \u201cI shall probably\r\nwish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better\r\ntake a look at the lower windows before I go up.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the\r\nlarge one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he\r\nopened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his\r\npowerful magnifying lens. \u201cNow we shall go upstairs,\u201d said he at last.\r\n\r\nThe banker\u2019s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with\r\na grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the\r\nbureau first and looked hard at the lock.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich key was used to open it?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat which my son himself indicated\u2014that of the cupboard of the\r\nlumber-room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you it here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is it on the dressing-table.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a noiseless lock,\u201d said he. \u201cIt is no wonder that it did not\r\nwake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a\r\nlook at it.\u201d He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it\r\nupon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller\u2019s art,\r\nand the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one\r\nside of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three\r\ngems had been torn away.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Holder,\u201d said Holmes, \u201chere is the corner which corresponds\r\nto that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will\r\nbreak it off.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe banker recoiled in horror. \u201cI should not dream of trying,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I will.\u201d Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without\r\nresult. \u201cI feel it give a little,\u201d said he; \u201cbut, though I am\r\nexceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to\r\nbreak it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would\r\nhappen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a\r\npistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards\r\nof your bed and that you heard nothing of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss\r\nHolder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI confess that I still share my uncle\u2019s perplexity.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck\r\nduring this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not\r\nsucceed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I\r\nshall now continue my investigations outside.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any\r\nunnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour\r\nor more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow\r\nand his features as inscrutable as ever.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,\u201d\r\nsaid he; \u201cI can serve you best by returning to my rooms.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe banker wrung his hands. \u201cI shall never see them again!\u201d he cried.\r\n\u201cAnd my son? You give me hopes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy opinion is in no way altered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, for God\u2019s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in\r\nmy house last night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning\r\nbetween nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it\r\nclearer. I understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you,\r\nprovided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on\r\nthe sum I may draw.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would give my fortune to have them back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.\r\nGood-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again\r\nbefore evening.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was obvious to me that my companion\u2019s mind was now made up about the\r\ncase, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even\r\ndimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured\r\nto sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other\r\ntopic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three\r\nwhen we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his\r\nchamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer.\r\nWith his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and\r\nhis worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that this should do,\u201d said he, glancing into the glass above\r\nthe fireplace. \u201cI only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I\r\nfear that it won\u2019t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may\r\nbe following a will-o\u2019-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I\r\nhope that I may be back in a few hours.\u201d He cut a slice of beef from\r\nthe joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of\r\nbread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon\r\nhis expedition.\r\n\r\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent\r\nspirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it\r\ndown into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\r\n\r\n\u201cI only looked in as I passed,\u201d said he. \u201cI am going right on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I\r\nget back. Don\u2019t wait up for me in case I should be late.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow are you getting on?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since\r\nI saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet\r\nlittle problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.\r\nHowever, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable\r\nclothes off and return to my highly respectable self.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction\r\nthan his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even\r\na touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a\r\nfew minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that\r\nhe was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\r\n\r\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I\r\nretired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for\r\ndays and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his\r\nlateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in,\r\nbut when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a\r\ncup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cbut you\r\nremember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it is after nine now,\u201d I answered. \u201cI should not be surprised if\r\nthat were he. I thought I heard a ring.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change\r\nwhich had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad\r\nand massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed\r\nto me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy\r\nwhich was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,\r\nand he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,\u201d said he.\r\n\u201cOnly two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in\r\nthe world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow\r\ncomes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDeserted you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty,\r\nand a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last\r\nnight, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all\r\nmight have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say\r\nso. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\r\n\r\n    \u201c\u2018MY DEAREST UNCLE,\u2014I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,\r\n    and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might\r\n    never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever\r\n    again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you\r\n    forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for;\r\n    and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless\r\n    labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever\r\n    your loving,\r\n\r\n\r\n    \u201c\u2018MARY.\u2019\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points\r\nto suicide?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution.\r\nI trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned\r\nsomething! Where are the gems?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou would not think \u00a3 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would pay ten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And\r\nthere is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a\r\npen. Better make it out for \u00a3 4000.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked\r\nover to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three\r\ngems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\r\n\r\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have it!\u201d he gasped. \u201cI am saved! I am saved!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he\r\nhugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes\r\nrather sternly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOwe!\u201d He caught up a pen. \u201cName the sum, and I will pay it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble\r\nlad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be\r\nproud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen it was not Arthur who took them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know\r\nthat the truth is known.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview\r\nwith him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to\r\nhim, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very\r\nfew details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this\r\nmorning, however, may open his lips.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor Heaven\u2019s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And\r\nlet me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and\r\nfor you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George\r\nBurnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy Mary? Impossible!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor\r\nyour son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into\r\nyour family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England\u2014a\r\nruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or\r\nconscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his\r\nvows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered\r\nherself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what\r\nhe said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of\r\nseeing him nearly every evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot, and I will not, believe it!\u201d cried the banker with an ashen\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your\r\nniece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down\r\nand talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable\r\nlane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he\r\nstood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold\r\nkindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that\r\nshe loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover\r\nextinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one.\r\nShe had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming\r\ndownstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about\r\none of the servants\u2019 escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was\r\nall perfectly true.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he\r\nslept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the\r\nmiddle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose\r\nand, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very\r\nstealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your\r\ndressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some\r\nclothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this\r\nstrange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the\r\nlight of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious\r\ncoronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling\r\nwith horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door,\r\nwhence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her\r\nstealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the\r\ngloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing\r\nquite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a\r\nhorrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she\r\nwas gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you,\r\nand how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as\r\nhe was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow,\r\nand ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the\r\nmoonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught\r\nhim, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one\r\nside of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle,\r\nyour son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something\r\nsuddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his\r\nhands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had\r\njust observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was\r\nendeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it possible?\u201d gasped the banker.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he\r\nfelt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the\r\ntrue state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved\r\nlittle enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous\r\nview, however, and preserved her secret.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,\u201d\r\ncried Mr. Holder. \u201cOh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his\r\nasking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted\r\nto see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How\r\ncruelly I have misjudged him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I arrived at the house,\u201d continued Holmes, \u201cI at once went very\r\ncarefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow\r\nwhich might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening\r\nbefore, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve\r\nimpressions. I passed along the tradesmen\u2019s path, but found it all\r\ntrampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the\r\nfar side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,\r\nwhose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I\r\ncould even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run\r\nback swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel\r\nmarks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I\r\nthought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of\r\nwhom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I\r\npassed round the garden without seeing anything more than random\r\ntracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable\r\nlane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\r\nline which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was\r\nat once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your\r\nson. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and\r\nas his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it\r\nwas obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and\r\nfound they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow\r\naway while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred\r\nyards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where\r\nthe snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally,\r\nwhere a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not\r\nmistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge\r\nof blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the\r\nhigh road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared,\r\nso there was an end to that clue.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill\r\nand framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see\r\nthat someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an\r\ninstep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then\r\nbeginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man\r\nhad waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed\r\nhad been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled\r\nwith him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength\r\ncausing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had\r\nreturned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his\r\nopponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man, and\r\nwho was it brought him the coronet?\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,\r\nwhatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew\r\nthat it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained\r\nyour niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son\r\nallow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible\r\nreason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent\r\nexplanation why he should retain her secret\u2014the more so as the secret\r\nwas a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that\r\nwindow, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my\r\nconjecture became a certainty.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for\r\nwho else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to\r\nyou? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends\r\nwas a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had\r\nheard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It\r\nmust have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems.\r\nEven though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still\r\nflatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word\r\nwithout compromising his own family.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I\r\nwent in the shape of a loafer to Sir George\u2019s house, managed to pick up\r\nan acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his\r\nhead the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings,\r\nmade all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I\r\njourneyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the\r\ntracks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,\u201d said Mr.\r\nHolder.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and\r\nchanged my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then,\r\nfor I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I\r\nknew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the\r\nmatter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything.\r\nBut when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to\r\nbluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man,\r\nhowever, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike.\r\nThen he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give\r\nhim a price for the stones he held\u2014\u00a3 1000 apiece. That brought out the\r\nfirst signs of grief that he had shown. \u2018Why, dash it all!\u2019 said he,\r\n\u2018I\u2019ve let them go at six hundred for the three!\u2019 I soon managed to get\r\nthe address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there\r\nwould be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I\r\ngot our stones at \u00a3 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told\r\nhim that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o\u2019clock,\r\nafter what I may call a really hard day\u2019s work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA day which has saved England from a great public scandal,\u201d said the\r\nbanker, rising. \u201cSir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall\r\nnot find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed\r\nexceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy\r\nto apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you\r\ntell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can\r\ninform me where she is now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that we may safely say,\u201d returned Holmes, \u201cthat she is\r\nwherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that\r\nwhatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient\r\npunishment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the man who loves art for its own sake,\u201d remarked Sherlock Holmes,\r\ntossing aside the advertisement sheet of _The Daily Telegraph_, \u201cit is\r\nfrequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the\r\nkeenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe,\r\nWatson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little\r\nrecords of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I\r\nam bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence\r\nnot so much to the many _causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres_ and sensational trials in\r\nwhich I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been\r\ntrivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of\r\ndeduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special\r\nprovince.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d said I, smiling, \u201cI cannot quite hold myself absolved from\r\nthe charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have erred, perhaps,\u201d he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with\r\nthe tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont\r\nto replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a\r\nmeditative mood\u2014\u201cyou have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and\r\nlife into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the\r\ntask of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect\r\nwhich is really the only notable feature about the thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,\u201d I\r\nremarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I\r\nhad more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend\u2019s\r\nsingular character.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it is not selfishness or conceit,\u201d said he, answering, as was his\r\nwont, my thoughts rather than my words. \u201cIf I claim full justice for my\r\nart, it is because it is an impersonal thing\u2014a thing beyond myself.\r\nCrime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather\r\nthan upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what\r\nshould have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast\r\non either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A\r\nthick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the\r\nopposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy\r\nyellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and\r\nglimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet.\r\nSherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously\r\ninto the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,\r\nhaving apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet\r\ntemper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the same time,\u201d he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat\r\npuffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, \u201cyou can hardly\r\nbe open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you\r\nhave been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not\r\ntreat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I\r\nendeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of\r\nMiss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the\r\ntwisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters\r\nwhich are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational,\r\nI fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe end may have been so,\u201d I answered, \u201cbut the methods I hold to have\r\nbeen novel and of interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant\r\npublic, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by\r\nhis left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction!\r\nBut, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of\r\nthe great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all\r\nenterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to\r\nbe degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and\r\ngiving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I\r\nhave touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning\r\nmarks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!\u201d He tossed a crumpled letter\r\nacross to me.\r\n\r\nIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n    \u201cDEAR MR. HOLMES,\u2014I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I\r\n    should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to\r\n    me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do\r\n    not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n    \u201cVIOLET HUNTER.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know the young lady?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is half-past ten now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember\r\nthat the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim\r\nat first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this\r\ncase, also.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for\r\nhere, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was\r\nplainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a\r\nplover\u2019s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own\r\nway to make in the world.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,\u201d said she, as my\r\ncompanion rose to greet her, \u201cbut I have had a very strange experience,\r\nand as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask\r\nadvice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what\r\nI should do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I\r\ncan to serve you.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and\r\nspeech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion,\r\nand then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips\r\ntogether, to listen to her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been a governess for five years,\u201d said she, \u201cin the family of\r\nColonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an\r\nappointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to\r\nAmerica with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I\r\nadvertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last\r\nthe little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my\r\nwit\u2019s end as to what I should do.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called\r\nWestaway\u2019s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see\r\nwhether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the\r\nname of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss\r\nStoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are\r\nseeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by\r\none, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything\r\nwhich would suit them.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as\r\nusual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout\r\nman with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down\r\nin fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of\r\nglasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered.\r\nAs I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to\r\nMiss Stoper.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That will do,\u2019 said he; \u2018I could not ask for anything better.\r\nCapital! capital!\u2019 He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands\r\ntogether in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking\r\nman that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You are looking for a situation, miss?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018As governess?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And what salary do you ask?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I had \u00a3 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, tut, tut! sweating\u2014rank sweating!\u2019 he cried, throwing his fat\r\nhands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. \u2018How\r\ncould anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and\r\naccomplishments?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,\u2019 said I. \u2018A\r\nlittle French, a little German, music, and drawing\u2014\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tut, tut!\u2019 he cried. \u2018This is all quite beside the question. The\r\npoint is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a\r\nlady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted\r\nfor the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in\r\nthe history of the country. But if you have, why, then, how could any\r\ngentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three\r\nfigures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at \u00a3 100 a year.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an\r\noffer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing\r\nperhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and\r\ntook out a note.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is also my custom,\u2019 said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion\r\nuntil his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white\r\ncreases of his face, \u2018to advance to my young ladies half their salary\r\nbeforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey\r\nand their wardrobe.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful\r\na man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a\r\ngreat convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the\r\nwhole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I\r\nquite committed myself.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018May I ask where you live, sir?\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on\r\nthe far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear\r\nyoung lady, and the dearest old country-house.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018One child\u2014one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could\r\nsee him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three\r\ngone before you could wink!\u2019 He leaned back in his chair and laughed\r\nhis eyes into his head again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was a little startled at the nature of the child\u2019s amusement, but\r\nthe father\u2019s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My sole duties, then,\u2019 I asked, \u2018are to take charge of a single\r\nchild?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,\u2019 he cried.\r\n\u2018Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to\r\nobey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they\r\nwere such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no\r\ndifficulty, heh?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should be happy to make myself useful.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you\r\nknow\u2014faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which\r\nwe might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No,\u2019 said I, considerably astonished at his words.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, no.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my\r\nhair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.\r\nIt has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in\r\nthis offhand fashion.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am afraid that that is quite impossible,\u2019 said I. He had been\r\nwatching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow\r\npass over his face as I spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am afraid that it is quite essential,\u2019 said he. \u2018It is a little\r\nfancy of my wife\u2019s, and ladies\u2019 fancies, you know, madam, ladies\u2019\r\nfancies must be consulted. And so you won\u2019t cut your hair?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, sir, I really could not,\u2019 I answered firmly.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity,\r\nbecause in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In\r\nthat case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young\r\nladies.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a\r\nword to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance\r\nupon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a\r\nhandsome commission through my refusal.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?\u2019 she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018If you please, Miss Stoper.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most\r\nexcellent offers in this fashion,\u2019 said she sharply. \u2018You can hardly\r\nexpect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you.\r\nGood-day to you, Miss Hunter.\u2019 She struck a gong upon the table, and I\r\nwas shown out by the page.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little\r\nenough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began\r\nto ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all,\r\nif these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most\r\nextraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their\r\neccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting \u00a3 100 a year.\r\nBesides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by\r\nwearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I\r\nwas inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I\r\nwas sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to\r\nthe agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received\r\nthis letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read\r\nit to you:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\r\n\r\n    \u201c\u2018DEAR MISS HUNTER,\u2014Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your\r\n    address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have\r\n    reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should\r\n    come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We\r\n    are willing to give \u00a3 30 a quarter, or \u00a3 120 a year, so as to\r\n    recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may\r\n    cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond\r\n    of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear\r\n    such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to\r\n    the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear\r\n    daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think,\r\n    fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing\r\n    yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no\r\n    inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity,\r\n    especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our\r\n    short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this\r\n    point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you\r\n    for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are\r\n    very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the\r\n    dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n    \u201c\u2018JEPHRO RUCASTLE.\u2019\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind\r\nis made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before\r\ntaking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your\r\nconsideration.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the\r\nquestion,\u201d said Holmes, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you would not advise me to refuse?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a\r\nsister of mine apply for.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed\r\nsome opinion?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle\r\nseemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his\r\nwife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear\r\nshe should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in\r\nevery way in order to prevent an outbreak?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a possible solution\u2014in fact, as matters stand, it is the most\r\nprobable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household\r\nfor a young lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, yes, of course the pay is good\u2014too good. That is what makes me\r\nuneasy. Why should they give you \u00a3 120 a year, when they could have\r\ntheir pick for \u00a3 40? There must be some strong reason behind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand\r\nafterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I\r\nfelt that you were at the back of me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your\r\nlittle problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my\r\nway for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of\r\nthe features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDanger! What danger do you foresee?\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head gravely. \u201cIt would cease to be a danger if we\r\ncould define it,\u201d said he. \u201cBut at any time, day or night, a telegram\r\nwould bring me down to your help.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is enough.\u201d She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all\r\nswept from her face. \u201cI shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my\r\nmind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair\r\nto-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.\u201d With a few grateful\r\nwords to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt least,\u201d said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the\r\nstairs, \u201cshe seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take\r\ncare of herself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd she would need to be,\u201d said Holmes gravely. \u201cI am much mistaken if\r\nwe do not hear from her before many days are past.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was not very long before my friend\u2019s prediction was fulfilled. A\r\nfortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning\r\nin her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human\r\nexperience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the\r\ncurious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something\r\nabnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a\r\nphilanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to\r\ndetermine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an\r\nhour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the\r\nmatter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. \u201cData! data!\r\ndata!\u201d he cried impatiently. \u201cI can\u2019t make bricks without clay.\u201d And\r\nyet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should\r\never have accepted such a situation.\r\n\r\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I\r\nwas thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those\r\nall-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I\r\nwould leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and\r\nfind him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the\r\nmorning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the\r\nmessage, threw it across to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust look up the trains in Bradshaw,\u201d said he, and turned back to his\r\nchemical studies.\r\n\r\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,\u201d\r\nit said. \u201cDo come! I am at my wit\u2019s end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHUNTER.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you come with me?\u201d asked Holmes, glancing up.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should wish to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust look it up, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a train at half-past nine,\u201d said I, glancing over my\r\nBradshaw. \u201cIt is due at Winchester at 11:30.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my\r\nanalysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the\r\nmorning.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy eleven o\u2019clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old\r\nEnglish capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the\r\nway down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them\r\ndown and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a\r\nlight blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across\r\nfrom west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was\r\nan exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man\u2019s energy.\r\nAll over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot,\r\nthe little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from\r\namid the light green of the new foliage.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre they not fresh and beautiful?\u201d I cried with all the enthusiasm of\r\na man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\r\n\r\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cthat it is one of the curses of a mind\r\nwith a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to\r\nmy own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are\r\nimpressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which\r\ncomes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with\r\nwhich crime may be committed there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried. \u201cWho would associate crime with these dear old\r\nhomesteads?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson,\r\nfounded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London\r\ndo not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and\r\nbeautiful countryside.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou horrify me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do\r\nin the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile\r\nthat the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard\u2019s blow,\r\ndoes not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then\r\nthe whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of\r\ncomplaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime\r\nand the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields,\r\nfilled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the\r\nlaw. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which\r\nmay go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had\r\nthis lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I\r\nshould never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country\r\nwhich makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally\r\nthreatened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. She has her freedom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat _can_ be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover\r\nthe facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can\r\nonly be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt\r\nfind waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we\r\nshall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance\r\nfrom the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She\r\nhad engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am so delighted that you have come,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cIt is so\r\nvery kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your\r\nadvice will be altogether invaluable to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray tell us what has happened to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to\r\nbe back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning,\r\nthough he little knew for what purpose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us have everything in its due order.\u201d Holmes thrust his long thin\r\nlegs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no\r\nactual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to\r\nthem to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my\r\nmind about them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can you not understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTheir reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it\r\noccurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in\r\nhis dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully\r\nsituated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square\r\nblock of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp\r\nand bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and\r\non the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton high road,\r\nwhich curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This\r\nground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part\r\nof Lord Southerton\u2019s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately\r\nin front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was\r\nintroduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no\r\ntruth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable\r\nin your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to\r\nbe a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more\r\nthan thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than\r\nforty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been\r\nmarried about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only\r\nchild by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia.\r\nMr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them\r\nwas that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the\r\ndaughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that\r\nher position must have been uncomfortable with her father\u2019s young wife.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in\r\nfeature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a\r\nnonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to\r\nher husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered\r\ncontinually from one to the other, noting every little want and\r\nforestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff,\r\nboisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.\r\nAnd yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost\r\nin deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I\r\nhave surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the\r\ndisposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never\r\nmet so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is\r\nsmall for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.\r\nHis whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage\r\nfits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any\r\ncreature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and\r\nhe shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice,\r\nlittle birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the\r\ncreature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad of all details,\u201d remarked my friend, \u201cwhether they seem to\r\nyou to be relevant or not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant\r\nthing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and\r\nconduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife.\r\nToller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled\r\nhair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have\r\nbeen with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to\r\ntake no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a\r\nsour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a\r\nmost unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the\r\nnursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very\r\nquiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and\r\nwhispered something to her husband.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said he, turning to me, \u2018we are very much obliged to you,\r\nMiss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.\r\nI assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your\r\nappearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become\r\nyou. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you\r\nwould be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of\r\nblue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore\r\nunmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a\r\nbetter fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle\r\nexpressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated\r\nin its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which\r\nis a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house,\r\nwith three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been\r\nplaced close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In\r\nthis I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on\r\nthe other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest\r\nstories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he\r\nwas, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who\r\nhas evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with\r\nher hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an\r\nhour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence\r\nthe duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to\r\nlittle Edward in the nursery.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo days later this same performance was gone through under exactly\r\nsimilar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the\r\nwindow, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which\r\nmy employer had an immense _r\u00e9pertoire_, and which he told inimitably.\r\nThen he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little\r\nsideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me\r\nto read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the\r\nheart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he\r\nordered me to cease and to change my dress.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what\r\nthe meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They\r\nwere always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the\r\nwindow, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going\r\non behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon\r\ndevised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought\r\nseized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On\r\nthe next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief\r\nup to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that\r\nthere was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was\r\nnothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance,\r\nhowever, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton\r\nRoad, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in\r\nmy direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually\r\npeople there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which\r\nbordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my\r\nhandkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon\r\nme with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced\r\nthat she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what\r\nwas behind me. She rose at once.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Jephro,\u2019 said she, \u2018there is an impertinent fellow upon the road\r\nthere who stares up at Miss Hunter.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I know no one in these parts.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to\r\ngo away.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Surely it would be better to take no notice.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round\r\nand wave him away like that.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down\r\nthe blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again\r\nin the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the\r\nroad.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray continue,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYour narrative promises to be a most\r\ninteresting one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to\r\nbe little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On\r\nthe very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took\r\nme to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we\r\napproached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as\r\nof a large animal moving about.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Look in here!\u2019 said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two\r\nplanks. \u2018Is he not a beauty?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague\r\nfigure huddled up in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Don\u2019t be frightened,\u2019 said my employer, laughing at the start which I\r\nhad given. \u2018It\u2019s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really\r\nold Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We\r\nfeed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as\r\nkeen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the\r\ntrespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness\u2019 sake don\u2019t you\r\never on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it\u2019s\r\nas much as your life is worth.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look\r\nout of my bedroom window about two o\u2019clock in the morning. It was a\r\nbeautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was\r\nsilvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the\r\npeaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was\r\nmoving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the\r\nmoonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf,\r\ntawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting\r\nbones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow\r\nupon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart\r\nwhich I do not think that any burglar could have done.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you\r\nknow, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at\r\nthe bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I\r\nbegan to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by\r\nrearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in\r\nthe room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I\r\nhad filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack\r\naway I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.\r\nIt struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I\r\ntook out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key\r\nfitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one\r\nthing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It\r\nwas my coil of hair.\r\n\r\n\u201cI took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and\r\nthe same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded\r\nitself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With\r\ntrembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew\r\nfrom the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I\r\nassure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle\r\nas I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned\r\nthe strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the\r\nRucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a\r\ndrawer which they had locked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I\r\nsoon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was\r\none wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door\r\nwhich faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into\r\nthis suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I\r\nascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door,\r\nhis keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very\r\ndifferent person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His\r\ncheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins\r\nstood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried\r\npast me without a word or a look.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the\r\ngrounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could\r\nsee the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a\r\nrow, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered\r\nup. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down,\r\nglancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as\r\nmerry and jovial as ever.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah!\u2019 said he, \u2018you must not think me rude if I passed you without a\r\nword, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI assured him that I was not offended. \u2018By the way,\u2019 said I, \u2018you seem\r\nto have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the\r\nshutters up.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my\r\nremark.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Photography is one of my hobbies,\u2019 said he. \u2018I have made my dark room\r\nup there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.\r\nWho would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?\u2019 He spoke\r\nin a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at\r\nme. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\r\nsomething about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all\r\non fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my\r\nshare of that. It was more a feeling of duty\u2014a feeling that some good\r\nmight come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman\u2019s\r\ninstinct; perhaps it was woman\u2019s instinct which gave me that feeling.\r\nAt any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any\r\nchance to pass the forbidden door.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,\r\nbesides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in\r\nthese deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen\r\nbag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and\r\nyesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was\r\nthe key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with\r\nthem, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently\r\nin the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,\r\nwhich turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner\r\nwere three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.\r\nThey each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows\r\nin the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening\r\nlight glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and\r\nacross the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an\r\niron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at\r\nthe other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the\r\nkey was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the\r\nshuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from\r\nbeneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a\r\nskylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage\r\ngazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I\r\nsuddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass\r\nbackward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone\r\nout from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the\r\nsight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I\r\nturned and ran\u2014ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me\r\nclutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through\r\nthe door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018So,\u2019 said he, smiling, \u2018it was you, then. I thought that it must be\r\nwhen I saw the door open.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, I am so frightened!\u2019 I panted.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My dear young lady! my dear young lady!\u2019\u2014you cannot think how\r\ncaressing and soothing his manner was\u2014\u2018and what has frightened you, my\r\ndear young lady?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cBut his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was\r\nkeenly on my guard against him.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,\u2019 I answered. \u2018But it\r\nis so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran\r\nout again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Only that?\u2019 said he, looking at me keenly.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, what did you think?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why do you think that I lock this door?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am sure that I do not know.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?\u2019 He\r\nwas still smiling in the most amiable manner.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am sure if I had known\u2014\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that\r\nthreshold again\u2019\u2014here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of\r\nrage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon\u2014\u2018I\u2019ll throw you\r\nto the mastiff.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I\r\nmust have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I\r\nfound myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you,\r\nMr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was\r\nfrightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,\r\neven of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring\r\nyou down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house,\r\nbut my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon\r\nmade up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down\r\nto the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then\r\nreturned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind\r\nas I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered\r\nthat Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that\r\nevening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had\r\nany influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him\r\nfree. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at\r\nthe thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come\r\ninto Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o\u2019clock,\r\nfor Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all\r\nthe evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you\r\nall my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could\r\ntell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My\r\nfriend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his\r\npockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Toller still drunk?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing\r\nwith him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there a cellar with a good strong lock?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the wine-cellar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave\r\nand sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one\r\nmore feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite\r\nexceptional woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will try. What is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o\u2019clock, my friend and I.\r\nThe Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be\r\nincapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If\r\nyou could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the\r\nkey upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course\r\nthere is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to\r\npersonate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.\r\nThat is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is\r\nthe daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to\r\nhave gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in\r\nheight, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off,\r\nvery possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of\r\ncourse, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came\r\nupon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of\r\nhers\u2014possibly her _fianc\u00e9_\u2014and no doubt, as you wore the girl\u2019s dress\r\nand were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he\r\nsaw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was\r\nperfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog\r\nis let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate\r\nwith her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case\r\nis the disposition of the child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth has that to do with it?\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as\r\nto the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don\u2019t you see\r\nthat the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first\r\nreal insight into the character of parents by studying their children.\r\nThis child\u2019s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty\u2019s\r\nsake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should\r\nsuspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in\r\ntheir power.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,\u201d cried our client. \u201cA\r\nthousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit\r\nit. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor\r\ncreature.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We\r\ncan do nothing until seven o\u2019clock. At that hour we shall be with you,\r\nand it will not be long before we solve the mystery.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the\r\nCopper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The\r\ngroup of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in\r\nthe light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even\r\nhad Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you managed it?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. \u201cThat is Mrs.\r\nToller in the cellar,\u201d said she. \u201cHer husband lies snoring on the\r\nkitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.\r\nRucastle\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have done well indeed!\u201d cried Holmes with enthusiasm. \u201cNow lead\r\nthe way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage,\r\nand found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had\r\ndescribed. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he\r\ntried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came\r\nfrom within, and at the silence Holmes\u2019 face clouded over.\r\n\r\n\u201cI trust that we are not too late,\u201d said he. \u201cI think, Miss Hunter,\r\nthat we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to\r\nit, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.\r\nTogether we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture\r\nsave a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The\r\nskylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere has been some villainy here,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cthis beauty has\r\nguessed Miss Hunter\u2019s intentions and has carried his victim off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThrough the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.\u201d He swung\r\nhimself up onto the roof. \u201cAh, yes,\u201d he cried, \u201chere\u2019s the end of a\r\nlong light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it is impossible,\u201d said Miss Hunter; \u201cthe ladder was not there\r\nwhen the Rucastles went away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and\r\ndangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he\r\nwhose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be\r\nas well for you to have your pistol ready.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the\r\ndoor of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his\r\nhand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of\r\nhim, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou villain!\u201d said he, \u201cwhere\u2019s your daughter?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is for me to ask you that,\u201d he shrieked, \u201cyou thieves! Spies and\r\nthieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I\u2019ll serve\r\nyou!\u201d He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone for the dog!\u201d cried Miss Hunter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have my revolver,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter close the front door,\u201d cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the\r\nstairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the\r\nbaying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying\r\nsound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red\r\nface and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d he cried. \u201cSomeone has loosed the dog. It\u2019s not been fed for\r\ntwo days. Quick, quick, or it\u2019ll be too late!\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller\r\nhurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle\r\nburied in Rucastle\u2019s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the\r\nground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its\r\nkeen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With\r\nmuch labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly\r\nmangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and\r\nhaving dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I\r\ndid what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him\r\nwhen the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Toller!\u201d cried Miss Hunter.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up\r\nto you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn\u2019t let me know what you were\r\nplanning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d said Holmes, looking keenly at her. \u201cIt is clear that Mrs. Toller\r\nknows more about this matter than anyone else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points\r\non which I must confess that I am still in the dark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will soon make it clear to you,\u201d said she; \u201cand I\u2019d have done so\r\nbefore now if I could ha\u2019 got out from the cellar. If there\u2019s\r\npolice-court business over this, you\u2019ll remember that I was the one\r\nthat stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice\u2019s friend too.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn\u2019t, from the time that her\r\nfather married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything,\r\nbut it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler\r\nat a friend\u2019s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of\r\nher own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she\r\nnever said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle\u2019s\r\nhands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a\r\nhusband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give\r\nhim, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her\r\nto sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her\r\nmoney. When she wouldn\u2019t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got\r\nbrain-fever, and for six weeks was at death\u2019s door. Then she got better\r\nat last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but\r\nthat didn\u2019t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as\r\ntrue as man could be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI think that what you have been good enough to tell\r\nus makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that\r\nremains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of\r\nimprisonment?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the\r\ndisagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was it, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,\r\nblockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,\r\nmetallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the\r\nsame as his.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,\u201d said Mrs.\r\nToller serenely.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of\r\ndrink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master\r\nhad gone out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have it, sir, just as it happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cfor you\r\nhave certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes\r\nthe country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had\r\nbest escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our\r\n_locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper\r\nbeeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a\r\nbroken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.\r\nThey still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of\r\nRucastle\u2019s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr.\r\nFowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in\r\nSouthampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a\r\ngovernment appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet\r\nHunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no\r\nfurther interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of\r\none of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at\r\nWalsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ***\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.

Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
